# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

## Men7a Chatbot

A lot of students whether refugees in the neighbor countries or inside Syria, are struggling to find the suitable scholarships abroad, and there are a lot of frequent questions that every student asks when he is searching or applying for a scholarship.

Our chatbot (we call it "Men7a" - it means "scholarship" in arabic) should be able to answer these questions directly, to save time and effort for the student, instead of searching in search engines or scrolling up and down in Facebook groups. 

A mockup is included in the challenge1 folder

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

Frequent questions that every student asks when he is searching or applying for a scholarship.
Examples of these questions mentioned in the use cases interviews are: 
1)- I am studying “e.g: Computer Science”, do you have a scholarship available in this field ?
2)- Which country and university is offering the scholarship ?
3)- How do I apply, what are the requirements, and what documents do I need ?

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

Men7a will answer these questions through a conversation on Facebook messanger, to save time and effort for the student.
### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary users are Syrian students lookig for scholarships. 
The chatbot will be integrated in a Facebook group, we contacted one of the famous scholarships groups that Syrian students use (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ScholarshipForSyrianStudents), in case we don’t get a response we are planning to start our Facebook group and integrate the chatbot.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The conversation can save time and effort for the student, instead of searching in search engines or scrolling up and down in Facebook groups, especially that most of refugees don't have proper Internet connection, it is easier for them to use the Messenger.
Men7a can also remind the students to submit applications before the deadlines.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

1)- The Arabic language: The Facebook group is in Arabic, we are planning to use https://wit.ai/ API since they support Arabic.
2)- How to feed the bot with scholarship data ?
