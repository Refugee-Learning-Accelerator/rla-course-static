# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

1)- Students: We found a student who has struggled with the same problem we are trying to solve (lack of physical infrastructure), not in refugee camps, but in a city where the electrical power was often down, and the internet connection was not reliable.

2)- Teachers: We have also created a questionnaire about the project and asked some SySSR members (a community of Syrian scientists and researchers https://syssr.org/) to provide us feedback from a teacher point of view.
We are going to submit the results of the questionnaire next week

### What was the setting of the test? 

We started the meeting by showing the intro video, and asking the user to test the prototype in the browser, then we asked them few questions like:
1)- What is your first impression about the project idea ? 
2)- How do you evaluate the app usability (on scale from  0  worst â€“ 10 best ), e,g: accessing the app, simplicity, useful dashboard, navigating through ?
3)- Do you think the project is scalable, e.g: to engage college students, parents, and to distribute the tablets gradually ? 
4)- Do you have any suggestions regarding the hardware, the app, or the content ? 


### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

1)- How are you going to ensure that you get the full results of the project, for example students may not learn at home where the tablets are not available ?
2)- How are you planning to provide the courses to different categories of students ? e.g: some students are 15 years old, but they still can't read and write.
3)- A negative point might be that course designers don't have any idea about the camps environment and refugees emotional issue. 

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

1)- Our plan was to design the software system to operate only on tablets, but now we know that we should provide a backup version for the refugees smart phones, this can help students to do homeworks, support self-learning, and the parents can watch their kids progress. 
2)- We could provide replacement tests before enrolling in the course, quizzes before moving to the next level, and courses recommendations.
3)- The educational materials should target the refugee learners, motivate them and take care of their psychological issues. 

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

prototyping and feedback collection, because we as software developers are used to start writing code, then we think about the other things like testing and user feedback.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

Prototyping is the most useful part, since it has allowed us to revise our ideas before we waste time and effort implementing them.
