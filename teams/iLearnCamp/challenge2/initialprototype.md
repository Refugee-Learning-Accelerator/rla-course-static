# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

The main barrier to education for refugees inside Syria and in refugee camps is the lack of physical infrastructure including school buildings, stable electrical connection, and reliable Internet access, among others.

Our solution is to distribute customized electronic tablets to refugee students, accompanied with a solar power charger and educational materials stored on the internal device storage (The hardware could be customized in China).
The tablets give students offline access to high quality educational content, mostly in video format, that otherwise require a fast and reliable Internet connection.
Educational materials will be sourced from various organizations, either in native Arabic format or translated from other languages.
A flexible educational system will be designed and implemented by us to offer a mix of self- and teacher-based learning experience.

Our theory about the need for tablets to educate Syrian refugees is based on the two following hypotheses:
*Syrian refugees suffer the lack of physical infrastructure to support normal education. Solarpowered tablets with large internal storage should solve this problem efficiently.
*Availability of trained teachers and mentors is very limited due to war circumstances. Unlike in stable communities, there is no viable short-term
solution for this problem for Syrian refugees.Tablets should emphasize self- (and family-supported) learning and boost the current ratio of students-to-teacher. 

According to one study, 86% of Syrian youth in refugee camps have access to a smartphone.
This minimizes the risk of low technology penetration and slow adaptation and reduces the need for training.
A question arises here about the need for tablets when smartphones are so ubiquitous. The answer is simple. Most smartphones, especially the ones that a refugee might carry,have a screen size of about 4.7 inches, which is too small for most educational purposes. Since the tablet will be the main tool of education and availability of other screens or computers is not an option, screen size should be large enough to yield any useful educational outcome, especially for subtitled video.
We suggest a screen size of 8-10 inches with moderate resolution.


### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

The tablets will operate using:
1)- a customized version of Android (Locked against any non-educational content like games and chat apps).
2)- mobile platform will contain interfaces for students, instructors and administrators, in this prototype we show how the student can use the platform to access different types of education materials (video tutorials, e-books, and learning games), subscribe in courses, and gets progress reports and notifications.

We used an active wireframe  https://marvelapp.com since they have all the tools we need to express our prototype (Android forms, menus, video player, ...), and it is easy to use and share with friends to test. 
The hardware can be tested when buying the equipments, while testing the software platform and the content has highest priority because it consumes more time and effort to develop, and it gives us better understanding about the students needs in early stages .

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

We learned that protoyping is very important for testing and getting feedback about our solution (we are looking forward to your feedback :)), before wasting time and effort working on an idea that might work or not.

### Who are your intended users for testing?
Children aged 5-17 represent about 34.6% of Syrian refugee population.
This is approximately the same age range for elementary and secondary education in Syria. Thus, We decided to give this group highest priority.
The project, however, aims later to extend its support for college students, vocational training, early childhood education and self-development.
