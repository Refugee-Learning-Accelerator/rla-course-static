# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

We intend to provide an app for vocabulary learning, through smart phones camera, starting from the fact that 86% of the refugee learners have smart phones according to this study:

The learner will be able to scan objects with his phone camera, and he will see the object's name on the screen in both languages (Arabic - English), we may also provide a brief explanation.

Please test the initial prototype and leave us feedback:

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

There are a lot of online language learning platforms (e.g: Duolingo), and translators (e.g: Google Translate), but the problem is they need a reliable Internet connection, which may not be always available for refugees (e.g: in camps).

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

The user will scan the object using his smart phone, the app will recognize the object (using pattern recognition), and will provide the name of this object in different languages on the screen.

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Our AR experience provides a simple, fast, and offline opportunity for learning contexual language for refugees in foreign countries, where the user can scan objects from his environment immediately using his smart phone camera, and learn the names of these objects in different languages, so he can improve his vocabulary while he is at home, classroom, or even at street (examples of these objects may be "chair", "train ticket machine", ...).

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

He needs only a smart phone which is available in refugee context according to this study:

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

It provides an easy way for learning vocabulary, by coupling the real world object with his name on the screen.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

We expect to have difficulty in pattern recognition, we don't know if it is easy to recognize objects fast on the smart phones hardware.
