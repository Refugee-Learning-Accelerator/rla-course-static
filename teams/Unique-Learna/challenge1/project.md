# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

Our chatbot is built using on two different interfaces to implement two main components of the chatbot.
The first part is the body of the chatbot, the AI, the response system and basically the traditional chatbot.
The second part is building the avatar or model which will "do the talking" in our chatbot.

So to build the main traditional body of the chatbot we used Chatfuel, and with it, we made a simple arabic language 
chatbot which guides the user easily toward the learning material he wants to find. We made a system of courses within the chatbot (daily 
material learning) and more detailed descriptions and guidelines to help the user.
This part is traditional (uses text to interact with users like most chatbots)

Here are some screen shots of our bot (these parts in the making are tested on messenger 
and they are updated there automatically by Chatfuel)

As for the other part, we made a communicating and interacting avatar to be the voice and face of our chatbot.
For the avatar to do all the talking might be a long shot, but we are almost done with the face and expressions and 
we beleive we can make it very helpful and interactive.

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

As for the model and the animation we used adobe character animator and for the chat bot it self we used chatfuel.

### What challenges did you face?

We started with the modeling and animation with the MAYA and used an engine to do the facial expressions
and the body language but that was very challenging so we decided to convert to another program which will make he chat bot lighter.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

We like that the chatbot  will be saving time and influencing others to improve their lives and quality of living through learning.
It will also include a moving and conversational avatar which will make the chatbot more friendly to users.

### What would you different in the future? 

For the animation part we will be doing different avatars and voices to make more convent to the student and have it more customized to the personal character.
We also contacted the (internet.org) foundation to provide the support for using this chat-bot for free,
as all the data which the chat-bot will be using from the network provider will be all for free as the foundation had showed
a big support for our idea as one of our team members is the MENA region representative for the foundation and they replied to be more than happy to help our project.

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

The chatbot was done using Chatfuel which is a code free interface.
