# Challenge 3 Final Project

## Description

As we have previously described in our concept, we originaly thought of a flexible way to use QR codes and AR to help overcome the language barrier. For a start we decided to develop a card game inspired by Pokemon and Yugi-oh! card games we used to collect when we were kids.

The idea was to create a card game which helps young refugees name objects in three languages. The choice of the objects depends on the context in which they live. The cards contain a QR code that can be scanned with the Sawerli android app we created. Once scanned, a 3D model of an object and its name in English, Arabic and french appear on the screen. An audio file containing the pronounciation of these words automatically plays as well.
The cards are categorized by type and difficulty level. The kids would collect them to get achievements and reach higher levels.

## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

We built the Sawerli application using Unity. We used Vuforia to augment 3D models onto auto-generated QR codes, with the texts and the audio file. As for the prototype card, we designed it using Adobe Photoshop and printed it out so that it can be scanned with the mobile app or desktop app.

### What challenges did you face?

Even though we are familiar with C#, it’s the first time we use Unity or Vuforia so we struggled a little while creating the app. Adding arabic text was very difficult. We are still facing a few problems regarding the pause button and collecting user’s data as we know we still have a lot to learn to make a better app.

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best? 

We really did enjoy the whole process from building the app to testing it with the prototype card. This project helped improve our teamwork, since we worked on both material and virtual media simultaneously to make a combination of tangible and intangible learning tool.

### What would you different in the future? 

Our vision for the future is to make a fun and educational tool at the same time. For this we will need to make the app more challenging by implementing a scoring system so that the kids would want to collect more cards. We still have a lot to improve in our skills in order to make this happen.
