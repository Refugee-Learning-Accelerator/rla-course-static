## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

 In a recent article, MIT MediaLab  Learning Fellow and research assistant in the Fluid Interfaces Group, Christian David Vázquez Machado, stated that ‘ too many otherwise thoughtful people are interested in mixed reality for the sake of novelty, rather than the sake of learning’ (Christian David Vázquez Machado 2017).   With ground breaking research, the Wordsense project where he is part of tries to answer the question ‘ How can we extend the world around us with information and interactions that enable situated learning outside of a classroom?’ The project’s answer is as breathtaking as it is high-tech, using a Hololens and similar devices, it can summon up words, soundbites and contextualized phrases to a learner who literally can use the world as his classroom. The Alternative team was just as impressed by this as anyone. However, this week’s assignment challenges us to use low-fi AR that can be used today in the harsh reality of the refugee and new immigrant, where things like hololenses and fast data connections are tomorrow’s fiction instead of today’s reality. So we asked ourselves, how can we employ something as impressive as contextualized vocabulary learning in a setting where these things are unavailable. Another thing we wondered about was whether we could come up with a solution that was suitable for learning both inside and outside the classroom, as to enable integration the formal learning that takes place inside of the classroom and enhance it with informal situational learning outside of the classroom. Finally, one of the questions asked in the break-out sessions last week was ‘ What would be role of peers/social interaction?’ That question stayed with us as well, because peer-based activities can really enhance the learning experience.
Taking all the above into account, the challenge our solution tries to overcome is: extend the world around the learner with information and interactions that enable situated vocabulary learning outside of the classroom as well as inside the classroom, by using low-fi AR solutions that include an element of peer-learning 

### How will the AR experience solve it? 
The solution we chose is very low cost and simple. Based on memory card games that have been around forever, we will use QR codes as triggers for AR overlay and Unity to develop an AR-enabled card game that can be used inside the classroom, outside of the classroom  and basically anywhere else to teach, learn and practice vocabulary of a new language. 
The complete set will consist of the following things:

1.  A-sides: AR enabled QR-Cards that can be printed out and that will, when looked at with our Android app, show an image, for example a simple 3-d model of a door.
2.  B-sides: AR enabled QR-Cards that can be printed out and that will, when looked at with our Android app, show an the word in written form and / or will play a short sound-bite with the spoken version of the word. 
3.  Existing game-card hard sleeves to insert the cards in 
4.  Cheap handicraft adhesive magnets
5.  Unity-based offline android application that can read the cards and perform desired actions
  


With these materials, teachers can create games that will allow students to literally take their homework way outside the classroom, but they can bring it to school again. A couple of examples are given below: 

#### _Simple homework games:_

1. #### Word match: 
    As homework, students receive all the A- and B-sides of the words learned in class. At home they attach the magnetic cards with the A- sides containing images to the corresponding magnetic cards with the B-sides containing the corresponding sounds and written words. They can put their combinations in an A4 plastic sleeve with their name on it and hand it to the teacher for checking. Or they can lay out their combinations next to each other on their desks for quick check-up by the teacher.
 
2. #### The world is your homework:
    Using the magnets, the B-sides with the writing and soundbites for the homework for a certain lesson are distributed throughout the refugee settlement by the teacher. For example the B-side for the word ‘wall’  is attached to walls, both in and outside the classroom for a certain period of time. Whenever a student encounters a wall, he or she can practice saying or writing ‘wall’ and use their app to scan the QR-codes and check their pronunciation and writing.


#### _Peer review games:_ 

1. #### Word Quest scavenger hunt:
    Players get a number of pictures of objects that actually exist within the settlement / refugee shelter. For example, one of the pictures taken depicts the actual door to the office of the Norwegian Refugee Council office. They have to walk around to recognize the location. When they arrive, they will find another player that is the guardian of the word and has a deck with cards to hand out for that specific word.
    The guardian will quiz the player upon arrival. In our example of the door, the guardian will ask the player in their own language to name the English word for ‘door’. If the player is correct, he or she will get the double card for ‘door’, with the QR-code depicting a 3-d door on one side and with the QR-code playing the english pronunciation of the word in-app and / or showing the English spelling  on the other side. Whoever is in possession of all the cards first is the winner.
 
2. #### Word Quest police:

- Phase **one**: the draw
    All players get a limited amount of double cards (both the image and answer sides). For example if there are 40 words and 8 players, each player gets 5 words.
 
- Phase **two**: the truce
    After receiving the words, players then have a limited amount of time to learn all of them. For example, if the players received the words at the end of their language lesson that lasted until 3 p.m., the truce would last until 5 p.m.
 
- Phase **three**: game on!
    During their day to day activities, players can stop other players by surprising the and saying ‘ stop, word police!’ The player who got surprised, the suspect, has to hand all their cards to the other player, the police officer, with the image-code up. Then the police officer will quiz the suspect. Every card that the suspect knows, he or she gets back. The police officer can keep all the cards the suspect does not know. 

-  Phase **four**: the moment of truth
    The game finishes after a certain time, for example the next language class. There a judge (for example the teacher) will note the final score by checking how many cards each player has in his or her possession and how many of those they actually know. The player who knows the most words 8s the winner. 
 

#### _Custom games_

The best part of Word Quest is that its flexibility . Teachers can use their imagination to stimulate in- and out of classroom learning by inventing their own games. A matured version of the system would supply and SDK that enables teachers to add words, sentences and images for full customization through a convenient GUI. Kits with magnets and cardsleeves can be ordered online at very low cost.



### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Intended users are teachers and students in low-budget, low-connectivity language learning settings, for example, but not limited to refugee learning in shelters both in the region of origin (i.e. Lebanon) and in first world migration countries (i.e. Germany).

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

Android phone with minimal access to the internet to download and update the app and it's database. The App by itself will have an offline database of QR codes available on site.

Although our users have limited access to the internet and 3G, they do have cheap android phones and so we do believe our idea is realistic. The user only needs to be able to download and install the app.



### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The underlying basics of our solution is that of the ‘memory’ or Flashcard game, which has been around for a long time both as a leisure game and in applications for game-based classroom learning. It is extremely versatile, cheap to produce and easy to use. Existing memory card games can already combine the written form of a word to its visual representation. This approach to learning takes advantage of Dual-coding theory, which proposes that information is embedded in both verbal and nonverbal representations within our brain . These representations can be bridged by creating associations between the verbal component of a concept (e.g. the word “car”) and its visual analogue (e.g. an image of an old Volkswagen.) In theory, the more associations you create between both representations, the more likely you are to remember it in the long run. Existing mediums already exploit the power of strong visual associations to help learners achieve their goals (think of children’s books, which are full of pictures) (Christian David Vázquez Machado 2017). To maximise this effect, AR adds a couple of important benefits to the existing concept of memory flash cards, namely the ability to have fully ‘ blind’ cards, where the answer only becomes visible when using AR, making word testing more effective, because ‘cheating’ is only possible when using AR. The second important improvement is the ability to play sounds. So the image of an object can be matched to how the word is pronounced in real life. Thirdly, the use of an AR app to render both the images and the spoken and written translations, means the same cards could be used to learn multiple languages, switching in-app by the push of a virtual button. This again save material cost, which is already low.
As far as possibilities go, there is another very interesting one: while our concept for now envisions us developing the QR codes, images and sounds, with the right amount of development time and funds, a toolkit could be developed where teachers and students receive a GUI where they can enter the desired word, sentence or expression, link it to an image, record a sound and have the computer generate the cards and add them to the application. This would make the experience 100% customizable.


### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

Mainly we expect the programming part to be the major challenge, since we just got acquainted with unity and only one of us knows C#. 
Apart from that, the on-field implementation and especially the supervision of some of the proposed after-school games might prove to be challenging.
