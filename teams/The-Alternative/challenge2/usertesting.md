# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

Originally we planned to go to the Bekaa Valley and show our prototype to unemployed adults, teachers and children. This proved to be possible only on longer notice. If this actually would have been a project we would really developed, it could have been done. However, not with the time we had and the scope of the assignment.

Working for an educational NGO we have some access to educational centers that use our educational content. We went to two schools in the greater Beirut area and showed children the Bus.

### What was the setting of the test? 

The setting was a table with the bus on it and an Arabic speaking member of our team explaining to the kids what it was and how we planned to use it. The table was quickly crowded with kids and a couple of teachers. The teachers give us the idea to ask the kids what they would do with a bus like that, which gave some great responses.

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

Positive:.
The children liked the idea of having their school inside of the school bus and being able to go to school anywhere.
Children and teachers loved the idea of having solar panels to run the ac and the tablets inside the bus.
About half of the children liked the idea of having only tablets to follow interactive lessons.
A number of children wanted to use the bus to go for trips outside of lessons instead of using it for school.

Negative:
Teachers mainly had thoughts about the cost of the project and its sustainability. They liked the idea of having the community run the project, but they were quite sceptical about sustainable funds to keep running the bus. Also they had remarks about the costs of training the staff and about finding qualified teachers within the settlements. One teachers had a story about how most of the qualified Syrian teachers were not living in settlements but by now had found an existence elsewhere .
Another teachers casted doubts on the ability of local Syrian teachers to teach the Lebanese curriculum in English or French, apart from the general remarks about the language barrier.
All teachers were very sceptical about getting rid of the school books and teaching the curriculum only through digital resources. They did not believe it would lead to the same learning outcomes.
Children were mainly worried about the space inside the bus and the temperatures in summer. 
About half the children found the idea of not learning from books very strange and thought they might use the tablets in the bus to play games rather than learn math or science.


### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

Mainly we would make sure to test the prototype with our target audience. While the classes we interviewed included Syrian children, none of them lived in settlements and by being in school, they were automatically not part of our intented target group of out-of-school children.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Most of the human centered methodology was new to us, but especially the part of involving the user from the earliest stages on. We do design e-learning material and we do test it extensively, but the children that use it to learn are only involved in testing the end-result, not in the design itself.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

We thought the power lies in the part that was newest to us as well: involving your target group in the design from day zero. It was a valuable lesson that forces you to think different and do things quite differently.
