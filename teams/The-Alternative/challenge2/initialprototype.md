# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

For  the second challenge, The Alternatives chose to prototype “Cambus”, a mobile classroom in the form of a converted old school bus. The bus will donated to and subsequently be converted, run and maintained by the communities it will serve. That means donors will purchase the bus and necessary materials, recruit a conversion crew and recruit and train a driver and two teachers, all within the communities that are going to be served by the bus.

The bus will be equipped with the following features:
  
1. Solar panels on the roof, to charge batteries to provide power for AC, charge student devices and power the on-board wifi 
2. A raspberry Pi server that holds existing Tabshoura  e-learning resources on an SD-card and serves as the WiFi for the tablets, a completely off-line solution
3. Room for 20 people to follow class
4. 20 Android Tablets that will be used for learning

We chose this solution, because we believe it can overcome several elementary problems faced by refugee communities when it comes to educating their children. What especially attracted us to this idea is that it takes individual existing solutions, looks at their weaknesses in practice, and by combining solutions, eliminates individual weaknesses. 
The solution we are trying to offer is providing safe access to quality education to anyone, regardless of location or background. The main problem we are tackling is the high percentage of out-of-school Syrian refugees in Lebanon. This is currently being tried in many ways, among which are second school shifts and Accelerated Learning Programs (ALP), which do not work because of lack of funding, lack of infrastructure and lack of affordable safe transportation. Another approach are emergency education centers in settlements, which in some cases do a wonderful job, but in other cases are dependent on volunteers and free materials and lack structure and quality. We are all working for an NGO that tries to solve that problem by developing free to use digital courses based on the learning outcomes of the Lebanese curriculum. We even have a low cost offline solution in the form of a Raspberry Pi server. Our resources are being deployed by partners in educational centers, but still fail to reach many that do not have access to these centers nor do they have access to internet or digital devices. Even using an old bus converted to a classroom is not a novel idea. One of our team members has tried to teach one right here in Lebanon, but faced again the problem of having to use donor-sponsored tablets with generic, low-quality content and the lack of a logical curriculum. That is why we decided to combine the Lebanese curriculum, digital learning, an off-line server with a mobile high-tech classroom that can go anywhere it is needed.

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

Instead of being a single software or hardware design trying to accomplish something, our concept combines several concepts into one grand idea, the execution of which would involve an actual bus. It is therefore very clear that our prototype will be not so much about physically prototyping, but much more about introducing our idea in order for people to get acquainted with it, understanding it and giving us feedback. A simple, tangible model seemed to us an ideal medium to achieve this goal, because with the above promotional text, the model can not only be shared on social media, with a large audience and ample feedback opportunity, it can even be physically taken to the communities that would be involved in the problem.

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

We learned that we still take our ideas central and our own knowledge and experiences. Because Human Centered Design is new for us, this was to be expected maybe. But still we like to involve the communities whose problems we are trying to solve more in the next stage of our project. We do however have to say that we also simply did not have the opportunity to travel to the settlements and talk to people there. In that way we were already lucky that our team has been working in these communities before and could use first hand experience from there to prototype this project. We hope that for the next stage we can make it back to the settlements, but time constraints make this difficult again.

### Who are your intended users for testing?

The intended target group are a couple of settlements in Lebanon whose children do currently not have access to Lebanese schools or high enough quality remedial education. There we would like to show and explain the prototype to potential students, their parents and the community around them, because they would own the project eventually.
