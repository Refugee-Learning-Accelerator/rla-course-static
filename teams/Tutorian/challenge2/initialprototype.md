# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

One of the main reasons for the refugee students to leave their school is the lack of integration and comfort within the school environment. Their status as refugees is also a major reason for them to be bullied in some schools. This affects the student's educational performance and weaken the studentâ€™s attachment to the school. We propose a mobile application that collects quick daily information from the students about their impression and feelings toward their school day. This information is intended to know the scale and the distribution of this problem over a range of schools. This, in turn, will help both us and the educational organizations to develop a better understanding of this problem. The solutions that can be taken based on this understanding, could be an advise to the student, a notification to the school management or an intervention from organisation for the proper support.

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

Find the app prototype available for testing in the following links:

Arabic version:  https://invis.io/VDEJKYKCJ#/264808736_HelloAR

English version:  https://invis.io/MXEJKOPW9#/264807951_HelloEN

It is recommended to test the prototype on a mobile phone, however, it still works as well on a cmputer.

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

The application prototype is a series of potential screens that the user can simply interact with, mimicking the normal interaction between the user and the app.To develop this prototype we used a combination of methods including Story Share and Capture, Point of View MADLIB and How Might We, since these methods can utilize our teaching experience as well as the scenarios we have been through to better demonstrate the intended solution to the users. The prototype was designed with help of an online tool for software prototyping, which is (invisionapp.com).

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

- The systematic process of developing a prototype has been an interesting journey and added a great deal of information to us.
- We also learned (through the exercise) to be closer to the user needs, and keep in mind the suitability and realisability of our solution through an easy to use prototype.
- New prototyping methods were very interesting to learn and practice. They make it way more efficient to understand the needs and present potential solutions for them to be tested.


### Who are your intended users for testing?

The basic users are refugee young students and learners. The application can also be used by the organisation management that analyzes the collected data and act accordingly.
