# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

We tried to get feedback from various specialised people in addition to the targeted users. The targeted users are current refugee students in schools who are expected to get bullied as non-citizen students. The designed application is also tested by designers, social experts and current teachers in order to cover all aspects of the designed application and see it from points of view that we might not aware of as technical developers.


### What was the setting of the test? 

To ensure the maximum amount of feedback received from the user, the testing was under these conditions:
- We let the users test the application without knowing the idea of the app or what is the use of it.
- The user was not told which buttons are active or which parts of the interface are pressable.
- There were no interruptions to the user unless he/she asked for help in case they were stuck. These cases were recorded in order to be fixed.
- We observed the time consumed by every user while testing the application and their impression during the test.
- After the user finished the blind-testing, a small chat took place to get how much they understood the functionality of the app.
- He/She was then told all the information about the app and asked to test it quickly after knowing the functions to see if the testing experience would be different.


### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

Many users agreed with us that this application is helpful with problem like bullying, as they felt that the targeted problem is a big challenge faces the refugee learning process. The application design, in general, was user friendly and the interface colors were well-chosen. The scenarios were well-structured. However, they pointed out some issues in the prototyped application as follows:

*Design aspects:*

- Using the face picture as back button was not clear.
- The app idea was not clear to some users.
- The similarity between different screens made it difficult to distinguish between moving forward of backward in the app, which affected the smooth transitions between the scenarios.
- The emotions of the face could have more cases and made clearer.

*Technical aspects:*

- Some answers are not hyperlinked with further interfaces.
- The user need to scroll down to show all available answers.
- The gift in the app was not clearly described.

*Others:*

- Some questions do not have enough options as answers.
- The targeted users are limited to students who have a smart phones.
- To show the potential organization users what type of statistic and information could be gathered from the app.

*Suggestion from the users:*

- Adding a space for writing free answers.
- Including voice interaction for children who still can not read easily.
- To include wider spectrum of users by providing different languages and including university and college students.
- To change the interface design such that it appears like the apllication kid speaks to the user.

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

- Enhancing the graphics in the app.
- Eliminating the need for scrolling the screen for more options.
- Adding more functionalities such as an independent back button and clearer gift amples.
- Complete the question scenarios according to expertsâ€™ opinions.
- Adding a separate interface for the users who are intended to collect the response statistics.
- Including the possibility of writing a free answer.



### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

- Many methods of need assessment were unknown to us as technical developers.
- The variety of prototyping schemes added a lot to the choices that we could choose from to get a more useful response from the end user. 
- Getting the feedback, the way of collecting the feedback from the test users and the points that have to be recorded and observed during the test were also new concepts and a very useful exercise to us as developers.



### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

- The ability to develop a clear and simple prototype is very essential and time saving. It enabled us of detecting many required modifications in the final product without the need to repeat any programming stage.
- Getting an early feedback keeps the developers focused on the users themselves. This also helps them avoid evaluating the product from a pure technical point of view.
