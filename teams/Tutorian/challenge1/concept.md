# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

In this challenge, we try to solve some problems that are facing Tembo Education, which is an early children education group that provides an early, high-quality education service for parents. Our approach is to build a chatbot that interacts with the parent. The chatbot uses text analyser to extract structured data from parent’s messages/questions. In addition to the main objective of the chatbot, which is summarized by sending daily activities to the parents, the chatbot will be enabled to answer the parents questions. Further, the database stores the responses of the parent to track the child’s progress. Based on the processed parent’s question, the chatbot processor picks the most suitable answer from the database” or ask for further clarification. 
The concept diagram is shown in figure1.


## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

The company’s current approach is to send daily SMS to the parents containing the educational activity. Then, another SMS asks the parent about the outcome of this activity, as an evaluation procedure. This approach experiences a difficulty in establishing a bidirectional communication between the company and the parents. This interaction is considerably expensive through  the SMS service. It also limited in time because it requires devoted human resources to answer the questions. The amount of text included in the SMS is also limited, thus, only very short explanations are allowed within the reasonable messaging costs, which limits the ability of the parent to ask questions or seek explanation about the learning materials.

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

A chatbot can provide parents with a 24/7 service for answering their questions, giving their feedback and receiving on-demand extra activities in their most preferred times of the day or the week. Chatbots are considerably cheaper than SMS, wince they depend on the internet service and do not require devoted human resources, unlike mobile phone service. The text sent and received by a chatbot is theoretically unlimited, allowing one conversation between a parent and the chatbot to contain as much explanation as the chatbot can offer. The feedback from parents can be evaluated automatically (in a simple form) to provide Tembo some quick statistics (e.g. number of parents who performed the activity in a specific day). This, in turn, will reduce the workload on Tembo’s employees, allowing them to expand the tasks on which they work.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary user of the chatbot will be the parents. Kindergarten teachers can also be a main user for the same service, depending on Tembo’s scope of work.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

Conducting a continuous interactive communication with the beneficiaries can only be facilitated through such chatbot within a low cost range. The chatbot also makes personalised tracking, curriculum domain expansion and cost reduction much easier to handle and achieve.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

However, this is also subject to prospective difficulties such as:
- Assuring a stable internet connection for the beneficiary parents.
- Utilizing a platform that supports Arabic language, with the new direction in Tembo to expand their work to cover Jordan.
- As a team, an effective communication with Tembo’s team is important to build a reliable database of  automated responses.  Due to the time constraint, during the next week, only example responses will be offered by the chatbot.
