# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

In this challenge, we developed the conventional playing card game with the help of Augmented Reality (AR) to a multi-player language learning game. The number of players could be two or more. The designed game challenges mainly the players’ ability to construct sentences and recall the vocabulary. The game starts with distributing an equal number of cards to all players. Every card is linked with one word through the designed AR app. The player who is able to construct a sentence from his/her own cards can put the sentence on the ground. If the player was not able to construct a sentence, he/she should pull a new card and check the new possibilities to construct a new sentence. The players keep, in sequence, trying to finish their cards before opponents do. The game winner is the player who finishes his/her cards before the others.

In this approach, we try to make use of the available tools in most of the refugee residences, in order to minimise the need to buy any new tool. Also, our goal is to utilize the same tool, playing cards in this approach, several times for several learning scenarios. These scenarios include different languages, different levels of difficulty for different learners and different sets of specialized vocabulary in topics such as Travel, Clothes, Plants, Food,...etc. Another advantage of this proposed game is the fact that the same tools can be used for several games with different regulations. This is because the rules of the games can be derived from the rules of common known card games.
The proposed game encourages the concept of collaborative peer-to-peer learning. Since the game itself doesn’t require any supervisor to judge the correctness of the sentences, the learner players have the motive to check each other’s sentences and correct them, in order to increase their chances of winning.

In the following pictures, the game first prototype is illustrated.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

- Learning new language does not include only learning vocabularies but also grammar and the way of constructing a correct sentence. The designed AR app help the learners to learn both, new vocabulary and construction of sentences in a collaborative and entertaining way.
- Another challenge that AR can solve is the need of new tools and learning materials (such as books) for different languages or levels.
- The learner engagement in the learning process is a big issue that AR can effectively participate in solving through providing a very interesting and entertaining environment for the learners.


### How will the AR experience solve it? 

AR let the proposed playing card game to have endless scenarios and levels, using the same tools. Beginner learners can choose an easy level on the proposed app, which will be reflected on the simplicity of vocabulary and the used grammar. Every level has various specialized sets of vocabulary.
The ability of AR to create interest and engage learners helps, to a great level, the idea of group learning where it opens the door for correcting grammar and sentence structure among the learners themselves without a teacher.


### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Language learners from different ages who have smart mobiles/tablets. Especially those who face difficulty in finding language teachers or enough time for language lessons.
The AR being a modern and very attractive technology, especially in the middle east, plays a significant role in engaging users who are fascinated and excited to try this type of technology on their smart devices.


### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

The game requires the players to have playing cards, which is available in almost every home, and a smart device with camera. The smart device could be smartphone, tablet or laptop. As most of refugee learners have smartphones with an acceptable camera resolution, we see that the designed game could be a realistic application for refugee language learners.


### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

With the potentials of the AR, learners can utilize:
- Different scenarios and levels, that could be switched among easily and effortlessly.
- Interactive hints for language learning.
- The possible visual effects and scoring, makes the game more entertaining and enjoyable.


### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

- Reading many different cards (up to 20 or 30) and visualizing the corresponding words at the same time is a challenge we are expecting.
- AR requires a certain level of features in the picture to recognise it. However, the small amount of features in some playing card designs, as well as the symmetry of the cards, increases the difficulty of recognizing every card and its orientation by existing softwares and low resolution cameras.
- We expect that showing and activating a virtual vocabulary hint button may challenge us since this is our first experience with using AR.
