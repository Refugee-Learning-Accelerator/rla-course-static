How might we leverage everyday technology 
    to help refugee students to be motivated and enjoy to fill the gaps they have in terms of studying in lebanon 
    to feel in control of their future.

This is a very challenging problem, especially taking into account the different problems we have to reach out for refugee learners and the relatively low access to technology they have. We will be targeting in our solution specifically Syrian Refugees in Lebanon. We relied on existing contacts we have with a couple of families we were helping on a personal level in closing the gaps they were facing while attending the lebanese schools in the afternoon. The problem they face are generic and some are specific and they are the same problems described in the second seminar. We will start by listing the problems:

- Language problem. They have to study in french while they used to study in arabic or english. The parents, when are able to, can't even help sice their education is also in english/arabic. This is a major gap leading to a problem between the students and teir parents at an early stage. This is a general problem, any solution that should be provided, will need to support some sort of "on the spot" translation or explanation in arabic
 - Low access or no access to high speed internet or even to devices such as smart phones and laptops. We were able to get the family we help with a low cost samsung pad (100$) and the neighboors accpeted to give them access to their wifi. But this can't be a global solution that we can propose at our level to scale. So the solution need to cater for that.
 - The infrastructure set in place for them is very challenging. Afternoon schools with tired teachers, low or no follow up. This is very chalenging for top performing students and impossible for students with difficulties. We see that even students who where top performers in their country are facing major difficulties to adapt. Students are also tired in the afternoon and this is not the best time to study. We are not even able to help a lot as when we can help (afternoon period) they are actualy at school. So our help is restricted to week-ends before exams

So we went wild with our ideas and we want to prototype a Virtual After School Center (a Before School in this case, since it will be more in the morning). This is a digital experience/"help center" that will provide support to the students off class rooms. 

What it will be:
This is a support framework that puts people closer together, help each other, get access to online resources (videos/chatbots/challenges) to fill the gaps they have. They get more exposure in the community to pave the way to future successes. 

What we don't want to be: 
This is not a MOOC providing a separate degree, it is not a substitue to the normal school. 

How this will be provided:
- A first page (can be one or even all of a facebook page/webpage/phone app/computer app) that directs to the proper age/class level as a first grouping mechanism
- Then a hallway in a classroom to select the proper class/topic, as a second grouping level
- A class room page representing other students (who are connected at the same time) and a virtual teacher (linked to a chatbot and can be backed by a moderator). The student will see himself in the classroom as an avatar. This can be as wild as a virtual reality class and as simple as a messenger discussion group.
- From there, we want to rely on existing technologies to provide the support and this would be:
    + A chatbot representing the teacher and that can contribute to the discussion happening between the students on the group. The chatbot will be picking up questions around specific topics and provding links to appropriate resources online. We want this to be videos, as we have seen an incrementing trend in students instead of going to Google to learn new concepts, they directly go to Youtube
    + A group messenging system (Yammer, facebook messenger groups,...) alowing students discussing the same topic to cross check information and help each other. A scoring system will be provided to "Clap" an answer from another student that answers the question. The more Claps a student will get the higher they will be visible on the wall of fame. (the chatbot can also be a participant to these ). The idea of this is to allow students to help each other in their language and at the same time socialize with others sharing the same age and concerns.
    + A question moderating system (like Askbot) to ask questions and vote on those questions. These can then be forwarded by priority to a moderator/teacher (
    + A quiz competition approach (something like quizclash! formerly Duelquiz by FEO Media) by topic. Allowing students to compete and also gather points and Claps (we couldn't prototype this, we kept this for later stages if the concept evolves)

We can imagine this as all in one application routing via API to the corresponding tool and at the same time, each tool accessible by itself directly to target everyone with different logistics.


HOW TO SCALE and How to Solve access problem: We also want to propose a service around this solution. We consider that this idea can be scalable by making agreements with Computer Network Gaming shops to provide this service. These are widely spread in Lebanon and luckily enough, very accessbile in terms of location and price. Also, since their low time is actually in the morning, this is a perfect time to provide access to Refugee students in the morning when they are actually not at school.

How to link it to their future and well being: we want the exposure they get online via this tool to help them get easier access to scholarships and make them feel in control of their futures. They will also be able to contribute back and help others via the same system

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*
The idea as detailed is to avoid doing heavy development and rely on existing technology, but just present it in a nice way to refugee students. 
the VASC will show an animation picutre of a school like first page  that has a window by class. 
You can check the prototype on this link:

and a video on a sample operation in here:

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*
We reviewed the list of tools available on the page provided by IDEO (https://medium.com/ideo-colab/quick-prototyping-tools-for-emerging-technologies-3fb56f62360a) and they are more advanced than what we need at this stage. We kept it for later protoyping. We checked the other tool mentioned in wednesday seminar: marvelapp and it promised to start prototyping after a 2 min video and they kept their promise (1m:50s). So honestly We didn't think much about the tool, we selected the first one that worked due to lack of time. 
*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*
It is not easy at all to prototype! Especially following a HCD approach.
Actually the exercise was easier than just jumping into developing a solution. This is because for each solution we thought of, we checked this against the problems already identified and the solutions failed one after the other. Even now, we feel that the solution is not up to our expectations, but we will put it to the test of feedback and we will adapt accordingly. In all cases, we have learned a very strong approach to tackling a problem in a good way that actually solves the problem and not provide a state of the art high tech solution that is not adequat to be used 
*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*We want to test this at least with: 
    - Refugee student: Age 12
    - Lebanese school student: Age 8
    - Lebanese school student: Age 11
    - Lebanese school teacher: Math teacher for 14y old
We will also try to check for other testers during next week who would like to contribute
