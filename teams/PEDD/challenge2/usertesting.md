# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

*
We selected testers from the people around us that we considered are directly relevant to the subject or indirectly linked. 
So the testing group was:
- a refugee student age 12 attending a lebanese school in french
- a lebanese student age 11 attending also a french curriculum school
- a teacher in a private lebanese school, although not working with refugees. (We don't directly know a teacher in a public school teaching refugees and we couldn't get in touch with one in this short period)

*

### What was the setting of the test? 

*
We prepared the test by stating that we want the tester to check out a potential application that can help in supporting students after school and that we are evaluating this application for a third party. Then we provided a web connected ipad with a webpage open at our online prototype. We let the tester try to figure out at first without any guidance how it works. Then we started giving guidance where they got blocked.
We told them that we need this feedback to be as open as possible as the more we give good feedback, the better our exercise will be 

*

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*
We received different feedbacks from the different profiles, we summarized below.
From the teacher:
The teacher considered this is too much work, since on top of the preparation for the class, the teacher will have to prepare for potential questions/discussions via the chatbot, prepare online quizzes, prepare explanatory videos... When we said that actually this can be enriched along the way like in the next 2 years. He objected and explained that the good teacher keeps updating the proposed exercises and the material every year, that the books evolve every 2 years and the approach to explain some topics is changed completely. 
The teacher pointed out that there definetly need to be a login and restricted access to the teacher's section to which we had links on the second picture where we have links for the teacher to post Quizzes and answer questions
Also, the teacher pointed out that the trend for a school students going online for help is not to actualy take a class or watch videos but rarely. The student would go online mainly to find exercises that can help prepare for the exam and to find material that are shortcuts as to what to learn to pass the next day test. And the kind of exercises that can help in this case are not simple multiple choice or True/False questions. 

From the refugee student:
The application was judged too complex with several links to get to what he needed. He said that a simple chatting system with voice/text/image messages capacity with someone who can help would benefit a lot more
He liked the idea of the virtual class at the start, where he would see an avatar that looked like him and that he can change appearance (he linked to something like the talking TOM game) and then meet others that are in the same age range and/or class and then chat with them, not only about a specific topic. So the interaction would come before choosing a topic
The language was definetly a problem. He said that he would be looking for something that can help him so it has to be in Arabic with explanation in French, or to be in the 2 languages. The father considered that if it can be in english and french, at least he or his mother can help too in this case. The student mentioned that the chatting would happen maybe in voice messages, definetly in arabic and even better in the dialect he is used to, so with other syrian stdents
He didn't give any comment on the rewarding system or the benefit of a similar thing in the application. Getting to meet others and build a network seemed a target by itself for him

From the Lebanese student:
He liked the first page that looks like a school picture and then click on his class. Also liked the second page which is the virtual class. 
he didn't like the third page where the icons where not explained as to what they link to. When we explained what each icon links to, he didn't like the idea of opening another page on clicking on the icon. He mentioned that it would have been better if the second page, virtual class, would have been extended to offer the same functionality on the same page with appearing and disappearing "boxes". He tried clicking on the actual avatars in the picture and expected to be able to interact with them
He liked the idea of being able to compete and get points but wanted to know what he would get in case he wins.

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*
We would do the following changes:
- centralize the access to the different existing technologies we linked to (chatbot via faebook messenger, youtube videos, Askbot for managing and asking questions, QuizMaker) via a same application that would still rely on these technologes but via APIs
- Focus more on the virtual class representation and have this be more active without the need to go to another page. Target to build an actual virtual class
- Add built in support for arabic and translation to other languages
- Propose a set of explanations that help the student summarize the topic, like present what needs to be memorized before an exam. Also propose some sample exam questions with solutions that can be sent once they finish the exercise
- Come up with a moral/virtual prize when a student is advancing. Some sort of badges to promote the student socialy or items that can be used in the vrtual class. Or actually physical prices. Also make the acheivements linked to the improvement of a person compared to his/her own previous results and the perseverance of a student and actually coming back to the class, not compared to others. And promote inter-student collaboration by rewarding helping others

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*
Actually, the technique itself is new. Although we are used to agile/scrum approach in our daily work so the prototyping/feedback approach is not new, the empathize phase is totally new. We are used to discuss with a customer directly on the requirments. The new thing in HCD approach is that we want to understand the pain points of the our target "customers" and then we will propose ourselves a solution that would solve their identified problem. Then we need to be very open in accepting feeback that could make us change the full idea
*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*
We need to stress again on it, it would be definetly the Empathize phase. Althoug not visible in the presentations/representations we got on HCD, We considered that a natural loop exists in this approach between the feedback and the empathize, as the feedback should be treated like a more focused empathize on a specific problem, but still needs to keep the same attitude of open mindness
