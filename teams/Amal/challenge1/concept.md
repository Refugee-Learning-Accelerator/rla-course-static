# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

Our chatbot will be based around providing healthcare services on two fronts: firstly, the chatbot will be able to provide medical information to refugees, especially those living in refugee camps, who have limited access to such material especially in Arabic and from a credible source. Even if various charities and organisations provide refugees with this information, having it on-demand and in a platform where privacy and a non-judgemental response is prioritised can be very beneficial. 

Medical information will include: pregnancy and childbirth related information; basic sex and reproductive health education; information on medicines and their side effects; basic symptom diagnosis; information on treatment of physical injuries. 

The second service the chatbot will provide is information on the nearest local health clinics enabling it to match refugees with healthcare professional volunteers. Moreover, the chatbot will be able to provide refugees with the latest information on relevant medical funding and grants.


## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

Refugees’, especially women, lack of ability to privately receive medical information on-demand in a space where they can communicate freely and openly without fear of judgement. 

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

The chatbot will be tailored to answer questions about a range of sensitive medical topics which some people might not feel comfortable talking about publicly. That a chatbot is designed to communicate with one individual at a time, especially if the user is the owner of their own smartphone, allows this to be possible.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary users of the chatbot will be refugees seeking personalised medical help in Arabic. The chatbot will engage the user by first enquiring which particular service they are seeking, then proceeding with asking relevant questions related to their issue.

One example is asking a range of questions regarding whether the user is experiencing certain symptoms, narrowing down the possibilities of what illness the user might have to eventually give a suggested answer and treatment method if applicable.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The chatbot will be able to provide medical information to refugees who have limited access to such material especially in Arabic and from a credible source. It will provide on-demand help in a platform where privacy and a non-judgemental response is prioritised.

It will also provide personalised relevant matching with healthcare professionals and clinics. 

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

Some of the challenges might include:
* Gathering the medical information from credible sources
* Obtaining copyrights to use the material
* Designing a comprehensive flowchart that gives accurate symptom diagnosis
* Keeping up to date databases
* Gather information for local health clinics that are not available online
* Designing the Chat Bot able to deal with different Arabic Variations
