# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

ِAfter much deliberation on what issue we should attempt to tackle and find a solution for, we have opted for the following:

- Target group: 

We have chosen primary-school student refugees in non-Arab countries (primarily Turkey) and their parents as our main target group.

- The problem they face with regards to education:

Syrian primary school students will be taught in the language of the countries they are currently residing in. This can be difficult on two fronts: Firstly, those who have not yet learnt the required new language (Turkish for example) will find it harder to keep up in school and grasp new academic concepts.

Secondly, parents who have also not mastered the new language will find helping their children with school work difficult and probably frustrating.

- The solution and its deployment:

Our team will test an online database, which is comprised of the following main parts, as a solution to this problem:
- An extensive collection of worksheets and learning resources in Arabic organised by student age and subject. This will fill in a gap in the market as such resources are very difficult to find online (in Arabic)
- Dual language worksheets (Arabic and Turkish) to help parents understand their children’s progress and supplement their learning    
- A ‘create your own worksheet’ section for teachers to make their own resources in an organised format
- A question and answer forum for parents to use and seek help from other members of the online community


### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

Please see attached paper mockups.


### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

The prototype consists of drawings of the proposed website. This will show the users (primarily the parents) how the website can be used. This method is cheap and quick to produce and the fact that it is not labour intensive means that the content can be easily changed depending on feedback.

Having paper drawings and mockups mean that we do not have to build the website and start the difficult task of collecting high quality resources before we gauge interest and feedback on the idea. 



### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

We believe that the prototyping process helped us in two ways:

Firstly, it was very useful for having continuous brainstorming and constantly coming up with new improvements and ideas. This is because not much time was spent producing the actual prototype and much more time was dedicated to thinking and visualising the problem and how the product could be used.

Secondly, the process really helped us put ourselves in our users’ shoes because we had to think of all the possible things that could be going on in their lives that are affecting their children’s quality of education.


### Who are your intended users for testing?

Primary school student refugees and their parents who are living in non-Arab speaking countries. Please see the answer to Question 1 for more details.
