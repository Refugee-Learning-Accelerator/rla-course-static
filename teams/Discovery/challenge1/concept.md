## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

We need to encourage individuals the use and the way of learning in our web platform.  We need to give them an instant feeling about what they can learn in this website. We are confident that once the person gets to know what we will offer, they will be more curious to learn more.

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

We belive by giving the visitors a taste of what we have in store for them, they will be hooked. So we plan to present random and interesting fun facts that will be taken from the content of the website. These facts can be general and informative about different fields of science. It might be a historic fact, or a new scientific invention, or a common misconception. 

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary user will be the students, or their parents. Virtually anyone can use it, it would be informative and fun to engage. It will be associate it with Facebook chat account.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

There will not be an exculsive function for the chatbot that can't be done otherwise. However, we believe having such an informative chatbot will encourage student to engage further with the website to learn more about interesting topics for them.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

At first stage, we plan to accept only the questions about general scientific fields, such as: History, biology, or technology. But in the future, we plan to incorporate specific questions, such as: "When did Napoleon die?", or "Who built the great pyramid?". Tackling such specific questions could be a real challenge.
