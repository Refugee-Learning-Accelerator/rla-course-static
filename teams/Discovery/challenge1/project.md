# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

The chatbot will be on top of Facebook messenger of our Facebook page "@PictorialEncyclopedia". The page is part of our project that aims to spread science and education amon Arabic readers.

The chatbout is aimed to provoke use for engagement. It urges the user to send a topic, with a specific structure: "#history" for example, and the chatbot will send radnom fact regarding that topic.

The bot message can contain a link for further information about the topic or specific fact for further user engagment.

Unfortunately, Facebook doens't allow public users to use the Facebook App used in the chat bot unless it's verified. We are still in the prcoess of development, so the application is not verified yet bay Facebook, and therefore only persons assigned as developers or testers can actually see it in action.

For the sake of demonstration, we have uploaded to the repository both source code and a demo screen record viedo of our facebook chatbot.

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

Chatbot biult on Facebook messenger platform, it follows Facebook guidlines, including using webhook (built with javascript) and hosting it on glitch.com

### What challenges did you face?

Facebook messenger platform was new to us. It took us some time to configure the application to be integrated with our Facebook page.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best?

We decided to make it respond only to questions with specific structure (any message starting with hashtag). The way we allowed users to use the messnger to communicate with human admins as well as the bot (depending on the intention of the question).

### What would you different in the future?

Currently, the chatbot is merely show case demo. In the future will create a separate database for topics and messages to be sent. We intend to use more sophisitcated message parsing, which allows detecting more complex questions. So in the future we intend to respond to questions such as: "#When did WWI start?", instead of the currently wide questions such as: "#history".

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

Code is very simple and straightforward. All is available with this document.
