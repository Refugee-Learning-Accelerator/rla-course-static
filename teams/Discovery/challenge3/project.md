# Challenge 3 Final Project

## Description

We followd the example of Vuforia to create a sample project that detects alhpbet letters (A & B separately).

Upon detecting letter A, an object starting with "A" appers (Apple). [See demo video for A](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/Discovery/team-template/blob/master/challenge3/AR-demo-A.mov).

When detecting letter B, an object starting with "B" (banana) appers on top. [See demo video for B](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/Discovery/team-template/blob/master/challenge3/AR-demo-B%202.mov)

We used printed the letters on an easy to afford A4 paper to use as triggering imageTarget.



## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

Unity with Vuforia.


### What challenges did you face?

- Unity and Vuforia required some learnign curve at first.
- We tried to make letters as easy as possible by using "Arial" font. However, aria font was poor for AR detection, so we moved tom some more complex font with destinctive features.
- Using multiple imageTarget was a complex step not fitting with our time frame.
- Not all 3D models are free. We used a free sample but it wasn't enough for all alphabet letters.
- Adding accompaniying sound of the letter and object name required more development time, we skipped this step for now.

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best? 

It was our first try. Creating our first AR project was an exciting experience.

### What would you different in the future? 

- Currently we created different porject for each letter. The porject should detect each letter and display the realted object.
- Adding sound of letter.

Source code was too big to be uploaded as a single compressed file. So we uploaded it to an external server and can be downloaded from [here](http://gulatech.com/AR-demo.zip)
