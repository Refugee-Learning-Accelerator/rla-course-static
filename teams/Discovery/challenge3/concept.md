# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

A game like mobile application with help of printed alphabet cards. Aimed for little kids. When the device's camera picks a letter, the application shows an image or animation of an object starts with that letter. Sound of how the letter and the word are spelled will accompany the visual effect.

A simple prototype can be seen in the [image attached](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/Discovery/team-template/blob/master/challenge3/AR-prototype.jpg).

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve?

Parents of little kids might don't know English, and can't help them with vocabulary.


### How will the AR experience solve it?

We believe that matching letters and basic words with visual images presented in AR can can  enhance the learning experience and facilitate the memorization. Especially for kids learning by themselves.

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Little kids who are starting to learn English.

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context?

An average Android phone will suffice. Along with printed Alphbet cards.


### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?

The concept of alphabet cards is not new. However, taking it to the level of AR can give a much richer experience that will associate the letters with the kids photographic memory. Allowing new letters and words to stick easily in mind.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

Never worked with AR before.
