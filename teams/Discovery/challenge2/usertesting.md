# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users?

We had actually several levels of test, as follows:

- *Concept test:* this has been done previosly, by friends and family.

- *Content test:* this is mostly done by obtaining feedback from our Facebook page fans.

- *Prototype test:* S-miles Center a Lebanese inclusive NGO for all individuals and those having mild to moderate learning difficulties and special needs. We had group of students aged: 6, 8, 13, 14 and 16.


### What was the setting of the test?

- *Concept test:* personal questions.

- *Content test:* feedback from real users and fans of our facebook page.

- *Prototype test:* inside S-miles Center. Some pictures are included in "prototype_test" folder.


### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)?

- *Concept test:* mostly positive encouraging the idea.

- *Content test:* Mostly positive. We got some complaints about syntax and typos, and demand for more content. We also had requests asking to enable users contributions with content.

- *Prototype test:*
For age 6: "It is beautiful".
For 9: Liked the video, but didn't understand written information.
For 13 & 14: Found it "Wonderful really it is so amazing".
For 16: "I wish they can teach us like this at school".


### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

We need to think of how to support different groups based on age and needs. We also need to find a balance between visual and written content.

Another important point is that how to provide a way for public users to contribute with their content, yet maintain quality and accuracy of information shared by others.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Almost nothing specific is new, however the process as a whole was new to us.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

Empathyâ€‹ step. Becuase it's usually an overlooked step, since designers sometimes have the believe that they know better than the customers themselves.
