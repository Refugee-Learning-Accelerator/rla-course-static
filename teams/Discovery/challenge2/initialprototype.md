# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

"The Pictorial Encyclopedia" is our project for the opportunity to deliver basic education and culture to refugee students in an interesting, fun and attractive way.

It's not intended to replace official education, rather a parallel method to show young people (refugees, and non refugees) how fun, interesting and important education can be.

A report by Ministry of Education and Higher Education in Lebanon estimated that approximately 255,400 children of refugees were out of school in Lebanon at the end of last year. Another report from MEHE and UNHCR says that third of refugee students continue school after grade 6.

Some of the reasons of students dropout are:

- Child labor

- Early marriage

- Transportation

- Language Barriers

- Children with disabilities

- Negative perception of the value addition of education

- Lack of functional literacy, numeracy, and foreign competency

What we aim in our solution, is to try to encourage young refugee or their families to pursue their education. Our approach is by creating a platform (website and moblie application) that delivers quality and focused educational content in Arabic.


### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

Prototype included in "prototype" folder.

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method.

We used real life samples of our content content already posted in our Facebook page. The protoypes were quickly made my creating mockups usingh photoshop to show case how different kind of content will fit in different devices.

Some types of content will be best fit in certain screen size:
- Main content will be best viewed using a personal computer.

- Info Cards will be more useful for mobile phones.

- Infographics can be viewed best with a personal computer or big screen smart device.



### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

Some content might need to be adjusted for smaller screens. This will lead us to consider changing delivered content according to user's device.

### Who are your intended users for testing?

We believe that test should be focused more on content rather than design. After all design can change at any point in the future. But content is the core of our project.
Currently we have already received feedback on the content from our existing Facebook page. We intent to build on that feedback regarding content.

As for prototype test, we intent to show it to few friends and realtives for test purposes.
