# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

*[Diagram,mockup,Video,screenshots and Logo, are all in the attached files.

-We interest in providing a project that mainly supports the Arabic language to target all refugees regardless of their level of education

It primarily offers free and easy accessible to its services to help Refugees learn and make new friends.

And we hope that the project will target the largest possible group of different ages and different places around the world for all nationalities and all stages and requirements of education using the current technology and encourage them to share their scientific and practical experiences among them in a climate of love and brotherhood to ensure the greatest benefit of the project

The mechanism of the project will be dynamic and self-development through the users themselves.

-As we know, millions of refugees individuals and families have been living in camps for years on the borders of some countries or as intermediaries in several other countries.

They are unable to learn because of the location, as they may be refugees in a camp located far from the nearest educational institution.

Or may be a refugee in one of the countries and lives within the city but finds it difficult to adapt to the customs and traditions and the new society in which they  lives.

Of all the above, each refugee will certainly have questions or desires for certain information that concerns him. 

Every refugee finds himself in a whole new environment away from childhood friends or relatives, so it will be difficult to identify others or ask for their help for fear or shame.

But we find that many refugees are specializations, diplomas and excellent craftsmanship.

From here we came up with the idea of a project that will be a chatbot where every refugee who has sufficient experience in a particular field can educate the rest of the refugees interested in the same field or who wish to increase their practical and scientific expertise , and eventually become hundreds of refugees to learn from each other. And share their experiences in a beautiful interactive and entertaining by the target ages.


“We have been given the commitment to complete this project no matter what it costs, We are sure it will serve millions ,and we will be more than happy to see refugees using SAWA”

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

*[We built our project in a series of workflows to mockup and iterate the system and dialogue. The following tools were used.

-ChatFuel  “Facebook Messenger”
ChatFuel proved to be helpful in creating a functioning mockup to design and experience the Chatbot from the user side. 
-Sketch (Messenger Chatbot UI Kit)
Sketch, along with a UI Kit provided by Facebook, was essential for storyboarding the dialogue and series of questions. We wanted to achieve the most natural and empathetic discourse possible from the Chatbot. 
-Principle
Principle was used to tween between storyboards and to export mockup videos of the user interface. 
-Adobe Creative Suite - Photoshop, Illustrator
The series of diagrams used to explain our ideas were generated in graphic software provided by Adobe.

### What challenges did you face?

*[Our team is composed individuals from across the globe working at different time zones and from different disciplines. We developed the optimal way of mitigating this bottleneck by streamlining team member roles and discipline interfaces. Also we took advantage of the time differentials by tag-teaming on the tasks at hand, while maintaining a group collaborative vision. 

Given this is the first time any of us have been exposed to building a chatbot, we all learning curves to overcome. Although it was challenging to make progress at first, we quickly make progress towards the end. 

ChatFuel provides limited and simplified possibilities in to implement our idea. The team was able to mockup the experience and consider the many factors from the user end. However, we lacked knowledge in AI to actually implement any of the neural network functionalities. We will need to use more advanced chatbot platforms to handle the higher technicalities. 
Another challenge was with integration of the Arabic language option, as the development environment posed issues with direction of the Arabic characters and the alignment of the text.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

*[Our chatbot will be able to serve millions of refugees who are desire for the knowledge. Our chatbot can support Arabic, because it is about self searching and selection according of the user interests in the database , no boring conversation need , for loosing the user time by typing .specially for users who are not familiars in using such devices. Every refugee, whether a student or mentor, will be useful in providing and sharing experience of a specific field The mentor can simply make an appointment in the system according to his/her free time to meet with the rest of the refugees and teach them skills. It will serve as a highly accessible platform with an infinite number of learning opportunities with no required prior experience. 
Sharing experiences between each other will increase useful information for everyone and give them an incentive to learn more. Joint meetings promote the spirit of friendship in an atmosphere of community and learning. 
Every refugee will teach something and will learn something in every encounter. This system targets all generations, genders, and background. When formal educational platforms pose roadblocks for relocated families with loss of documents and ID’s, this ChatBot allows for more informal connections learning opportunities.

### What would you different in the future? 

*[The team’s idea of building interactive Chatbot encourages everyone to give the information without exchange for money, but at the same time we will be able to obtain other useful information from others. All refugees around the world will be able to create educational discussions every day, within geographical adjacencies. 

Our virtual project encourages people (especially those who are ashamed of asking for information) to meet face to face in life for realism. It is the opposite of other chatbot systems that make the user don’t spend time with other people and lose the skill of real communication.

-SMS (send\reply) in case facing any internet connection issues .
-ChatBot will be able to offer scholarships(Ads)  that are suitable for the user according to their interests and personal profile.
-The Artificial Intelligence (Data knowledge ) with be able to predict the future topics/courses/sessions according to the previous one. 
-volunteers will communicate with each other at the same time to give interactive learning in the form of groups determined by age or place.
-some students may communicate throw chatbot to request a specific educational session from a volunteer.
