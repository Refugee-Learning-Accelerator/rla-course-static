## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

*In the recent years with the increasing numbers of refugees, many lost their chance of having a formal
education, therefore going towards alternative ways of education is a must to help as many as possible
of people to learn new skills and have an education to help them to survive and even thrive and have a
better future.*

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

*With the help of technology many solutions is possible, in this approach our goal is to help the refugees
to integrate in the community they are living in, connecting the people who are volunteering with the
students to give them the education they need.*

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

*This idea is very simple but very effective, because it depends on the people them selves which means
the main resource for the education process which is the humans will be available while the chat bot
works as the middle man to connect the ones who are willing to help with the people who are in need,
the budget will be very low as it will be provided from the community and the operating will depends
on AI chat bot to handle the connection.*

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

*While the users will provide information of what is required to the chat bot the chat bot will search the
date base of the instructors and teachers available to connect them directly.*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

*Many difficulties may face such approach with AI required to know the exact problem may face the
users to connect it to the right instructor, and also recognizing a trustworthy instructors will take time in
the system if rating by user is used while investigating their qualifications will be hard and requires
human power that we are trying to decrease as much as possible.*
