# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*How might we help the refugees at the camp visiting the clinic without waiting in long
 line and be able to receive the treatment they need.
 This way upon the arrival of the patient the doctors will have an idea of the problem
 and will save time, the red flags will refer the refugee to emergency immediately without
 the need of waiting the regular examination.*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*we provide photos*

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*Here the Chabot is being used to communicate with refuges to do a pre-assessment for the
 patient condition by recognizing the problem and taking the history and trigger red flags
 in case of emergency.*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*Testing prototype and receive direct feedback will improve the original idea which improves 
 it and cut the costs before starting working on the project, we can add some feature that we may don't thought off*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*Few UNHCR staff in Ankara-Turkey, co-workers*

-----------
NOTE: The prototype example was set with the help of a doctor, the project needs a data base
 collected with the supervision and monitoring of doctors.
