# Challenge 2 User Testing

Here is the link for the prototype demonstration: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eunZK83p4TOeD2kUj1KuquqguoO6vjLd


### How did you select your test users? 

*It is quite essential to have diversity in the focus group in order to have different perspectives and alternatives. Therefore, users were selected from different age groups with different backgrounds and personalities. The first 2 users were randomly chosen in a café and turned out to be architecture students. The third user is a 16 year old student who is tends to meticulously choose the colors he uses in his notebooks, and needs everything to be neatly organized when he studies; otherwise he has no chance in concentrating when he studies or reads. The third user is an 8 year old who is quite energetic; he is quick yet has the tendency to lose concentration constantly.*

### What was the setting of the test? 

*The first two users were found in a café, a noisy area where lighting had an impact on the image detection (details will be provided in question 4). The 16 year old was placed in room where noises from other rooms could be heard. The 8 year old was placed in the same conditions he is used to when he normally studies. The last setting was the best since sensitivity analysis dictates that only one variable changes from the original setting. All 4 were given a phone that had the app. The phone targeted a marker on a table, and two virtual tables were added. On these virtual tables, there were two papers sitting on them virtually. Users were asked to read the content of the papers. All of them had to get close to phone, and all 4 were able to read the content.*

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*Architecture Students: “This is an amazing idea that can save space in a room, and it is certainly a solution for a crowded refugee camp. We believe that the virtual papers were too small, and it was a bit difficult to read. However, we can see the ratio between the actual table and the virtual tables and papers, and they almost have the same size, which is why we suggest using an ipad or a tablet instead of a phone in order to have a bigger screen.”*

*The 16 year old: “Look I really love this, but I would definitely have a painful headache if I use this for a long period of time. I do not mind this small screen since you said it can be placed in a VR gear or a bigger tablet. If I use a tablet I can put it on the small table and move the table around, after all, I’m only reading from it; I’m not writing anything on it.”*

*The 8 year old: “Wow! Dad, look!” The boy needed time to settle down since it took him a while to realize it is not a game. “This is nicer than a book”. He sat down for a time his parents did not expect (although they were concerned about possible damages for his eyes). He read the content, and wanted to read it again, just because he thought it was “cool”.*

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*We had some issues with mixed reality, where Vuforia’s smart terrains weren’t properly configured on Unity3D, and the smart terrain section on Unity3D stated that the API will be fixed in later versions of Vuforia. Therefore, we would definitely use mixed reality for 2 things: 1) area learning- an option that allows tables can be placed based on their location in a room that is arbitrarily chosen by the user. 2) Allow the user to move the virtual papers around, which gives them the option to place the papers on any of the 3 tables.*
*If refugees were given a Hololens by donors at any point in the future, it would be an easy application to make, and it could be easier to teach the users how to use it.*
*Finally, if we had less technical issues, more time and a budget to work with, we could have bought Google Cardboards and tested multiple android devices and allow more than 50 users to test them for 7-10 straight days.*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*IDEO’s 5 stages of design were relatively new. Testing things with users from different ages is new to us when it came to feedback. Diversity in feedback opens many doors for improvement. We discovered that HCD is a never ending process. You can stop when you please, but you can never say your project complete, one can always meet new people with different perspectives, all these perspectives are potential additions to the project. The ideal HCD would be a project that caters to all the needs and all the desires of every single person on God’s green Earth. Therefore, looking at IDEO’s 5 stages clearly asks the designer to choose your audience from the very first step, and then the designer only focuses on serving them.  Once the first group is fully served, a product can expand its possibilities by choose a different type of audience with different needs (for instance, targeting students, serving them, then proceed to serve businessmen).*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*We believe that drawing things like we did in the first week was very useful. We first started discussing the idea by sketching a table, then drawing two extra tables in dashed lines to show the virtual tables. We also drew squares in dashed lines to represent the virtual tables. Once we did that, we directly went to making the real thing. We started the first week by showing people that a surface can be extended.*
