# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*Refugees in general face a lot of barriers, especially in the Middle-East, in living a normal life from all aspects due to severe circumstances and several factors. Refugee students, even at an early age, are in many cases burdened with more responsibilities than they could handle, most commonly having to work on daily basis to help support their families, which often comes on the expense of education. Moreover, even refugee students who continued education after being displaced because of the war tend to drop out and work instead. Many factors do make dropping out the easier more obvious choice for refugee students. One of these factors is having difficulty finding a proper workspace to study at home; like the small rooms provided for every family, and sometimes few families, at refugee camps. The best way to tackle the problem of concern is to, as much as possible, facilitate education for refugee students and make it more a necessity than a liability for both refugee students and parents. Hence through our prototype we are intending to present a solution that would facilitate education at home for refugees.*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*See Attached*

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*As for the first deliverable, we intend to present the problem and the potential of the solution through two videos. One video shows the limitations that face refugee students in a small workspace. As we can see, a table as small as the one shown, can barely fit one paper at a time which is not a sufficient space even for younger students at lower educational grades. The other video shows how we can make use of AR technology to provide extended surfaces as can be seen from the extended tray. Our intention is to shift the creativity from us towards the users of the prototype. By showing what we can do using AR as a tool we liked to involve  the user with the option of  suggesting ideas as to how we can use this to provide sufficient workspace for refugee students and what further facilitation can we add and provide.*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*Making a prototype is a human centered sensitivity analysis. The variables we change are humans who need different purposes for a virtual table. Optimizing the prototype entails catering all the usersâ€™ needs.*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*Our intended users for testing would mainly be refugee students since it is mainly design to serve the refugee education purpose. However, we would also want the input of other students, teachers and also other people at their own workspace to test the absolute flexibility of our idea. This way we can explore more ideas, face more problems that should be solved and optimize the prototype, and hence the final model, as much as possible. This also could be used by teachers as well.*
