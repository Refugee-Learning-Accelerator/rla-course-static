## Description

*Our Chatbot aims to tackle problems with learning disabilities among students at refugee camps. With education, people expect chatbots to be used by students for facilitate the learning. However, students are not expected to notice their own abnormalities in their learning progress. Therefore, the primary users of our chatbot shall be parents and/or teachers. When users notice abnormal behavior from their students, they can use the chatbot to communicate their observation. The chatbots job is to detect the problem by matching the users’ observation, and symptoms from learning disabilities that are stored (or pulled from) specific databases. The Chatbot is certainly not a doctor’s substitute, which does not give it the right to inform the users of the possible disabilities from which the students are facing. This is a critical issue because a faulty diagnosis by the chatbot could trigger anxiety among users, or even lead to the wrong action plan with the student that could damage their learning progress significantly. Therefore, the chatbot contacts the centers or NGO’s that deal with the possible learning disabilities detected, and let the users know how to deal with the students until the respective centers contact the user for a professional opinion.*

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

*Many students lose the opportunities to excel in their education with no fault of their own. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 35% of students between the ages of 3 and 21 are victims of specific learning disabilities (NCES, 2017). Additional percentages of learning disabilities are portrayed in figure 1 (attached). In vulnerable communities, students face additional learning challenges due to traumas or specific experiences that are caused by the crises in their areas. According to the UNHCR, bullying, people with uniforms and boots, and the existence of multiple organizations participating in the children’s lives impact their educational performance (UNHCR, 2016). In refugee camps, specific impacts on education seize to be detected due to the high number of refugees, lack of resources, and lack of proper means of communication for such issues.*

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

*The chatbot will provide a mean of communication for concerned parents and teachers that does not only provide suggestions on how to treat (socially not medically) and observe the students, but also contact/refer the professional NGO's and Centers that are specialized with the specific learning disability.*

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

*Parents and Teachers*

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

*The first step in tackling this issue is to admit that there is, in fact, a problem with the student performance. Based on the aforementioned description, the chatbot will allow parents/users to express their concerns in their students'/children's learning behaviors in their own words, without any judgement from any human being, as if the parents are talking to a virtual intermediary to make it easier for them. Furthermore, it is a herculean task to look around for professional help in refugee camps due to lack of exposure to the topic, and lack of resources. Therefore, this chatbot just refers them and could even contact the professional parties that are specialized in tackling the respective disabilities among refugee students.*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

*1) Inaccurate description (due to dialects or lack of awareness) by users which makes it harder to detect disabilities. 2) Users could be uncooperative or unwilling to use it due to denial or cultural barriers. 3) Students could be unwilling to receive treatment.*
