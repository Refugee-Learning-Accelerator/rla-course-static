*GIVEN THAT WE CREATED AN AR EXPERIENCE FOR HCD, WE WILL BE USING VR FOR THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE*

## Description

*There are multiple cultural barriers that place women at a disadvantage in underdeveloped/underprivileged areas. This phenomenon mostly affects the opportunities for women to express themselves freely. We have contacted the Norwegian Refugee Camp in Jordan, and they have informed us that the English Language is considered an impediment in countries that do not speak Arabic. In Jordan, women may face this issue with international organizations, but translators are present at all times. However, in some cases, women need their own privacy, and it is their prerogative to ask for their privacy when needed. In cases like medical issues, particularly when women communicate with Doctor’s who do not understand Arabic, women would feel very uncomfortable communicating their illnesses to their doctor (a gynecologist for instance) with the presence of another stranger: the translator. The English Language maybe an important tool for women to find job opportunities and, hopefully, redevelop Syria in the future, but learning the language must start with the tools that support women express themselves freely without judgment. According to an article from the guardian, one refugee stated “I just want to be able to go to the doctor on my own. I want some privacy. I want to read my own letters.” Another woman, Makida from Ethiopia said: “I used to cry when I had to talk to someone. It’s the way I was brought up; it wasn’t really respectful [in Ethiopia] to go up and talk to somebody, because I’m a woman.” Therefore, our platform provides a conversation platform for women empowerment.*

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

*Most of the refugees in Jordan and Lebanon come with a poor educational background which further adds to the sufferage of all the refugees, including refugee women. Refugee women face both a language and a cultural barrier when it comes to education that aims at women empowerment. Conversations and discussions involving the female health is one of many topics involving women considered in many cultures in the Arab world as a taboo and many organizations working with refugee women have added difficulties due to shyness among refugee women due to their lack of exposure.*

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

*Our VR idea aims at simulating real-life educational conversations and discussions regarding the female health to help making refugee women more exposed about their own health and break the shyness barrier. This will overcome the language barrier often faced by both organizations working with refugee women or doctors (gynecologists) coming from abroad, for example Doctors Without Borders, to treat refugee women by facilitating communication.*

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

*The primary user is refugee women. Since many of the refugee women already have limited knowledge regarding the female health, the VR will provide guidance to the basic information and terminologies prior to the simulated conversation/discussion hence enhancing the engagement between the experience and the user. Engagement could be to some extent affordable for organizations working with refugee women through Google Cardboard.*

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

*As previously mentioned, Google Carboard would be the cheapest and most realistic piece of hardware in the refugee context*

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

*In contrast with the 2D screen facilities such as Chabot and surveys, VR provides an experience that is closer to the real experience by simulating the real conversation/discussion environment.*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

*The technical challenge faced in this project would be in programming and coding the VR with speech recognition, particularly with the expected inaccurate pronounciation for new learners, which would require some sort of a voice calibration system to detect certain pronounciation patterns from users, although it is still uncertain whether this can be done with Unity or not. Other barriers facing such an idea would be shyness extending even to the virtual world.*
