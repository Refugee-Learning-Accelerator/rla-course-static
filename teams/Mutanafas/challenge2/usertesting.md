# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

*[Our test users were first the internal team, friends and relatives. The second sample of test users are the refugees student. SO we used the Google Dogfooding and Fishfooding methodologies]*

### What was the setting of the test? 

*[We have used the following online prototyping platform projects.invisionapp.com", that allows for the testers to experience a real experience. In addition, we have used the router providing Wifi Internet. ]*

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*[Kindly find the Test Plan document at the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fCKCPj9o4OhZly4RvwXvOBf0LWFJYGvt ]*

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*[Based on the feedback, we would add the following to the application:
- The search for volunteers teachers per the student geographic zone
- The capability to add group calls where multiple students can take advantage from the same teacher.
- The capability to add online courses like Khan Academy that allows to explain the concept in Arabic.
- Teacher and Student time availability? A time of the day when the student and teacher are free. So this can also help the matching process.
- To Apply all the NA points]*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*[Human-centered design consists of three phases. In the Inspiration Phase you’ll learn directly from the people you’re designing for as 
you immerse yourself in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs. In the Ideation Phase you’ll make sense of what you learned, 
identify opportunities for design, and prototype possible solutions. And in the Implementation Phase you’ll bring your solution to life, and 
eventually, to market. And you’ll know that your solution will be a success because you’ve kept the very people you’re looking to serve at the 
heart of the process.

What was new to us, is the Implementation Phase that was enriched/ empowered by meeting the students and learning about their real needs.]*


### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*[Certainly, the most useful parts of the Human Centered Design process were meeting the end users and getting to know the problem they encountered. 
We now entered in a new iteration cycle and hope to present the best to our audience.]*
