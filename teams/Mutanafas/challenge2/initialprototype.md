# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*[We have chosen multiple solutions to be tested:
- Application/ Platform that allows refugees' students to get the needed help from volunteering teachers across the globe through helping them in 
their school homework and to learn new concepts. Allowing to reduce the number of dropped students in the hosting countries where the language is a 
barrier to succeed in school.
- Virtual Reality that will allow creating new online schools/ classes where students can access it from home. In addition to get real time tutoring.
- Augmented reality that allows better understanding for scientific concepts.
- Hologram technology that allows better understanding for complex Bioloby and Science concepts and topics/ learning points, 
used also for workshop collaboration work.]*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*Movie Prototype uploaded on Google drive because we exceeded the allowed limit. You can find our movie at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1zzPpN2E8NZrERIQqQp4VK7GWNPbO07/view?usp=sharing]*
Please let us know if you were not able to access it.

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*[The prototyping on paper method aims to fake the concept until we make it, lowering the barriers to entry into design, to collaboration and communication. Using the movie making during the prototyping phase allows to reduce the amount of work using tech tricks. As already described, in the first question we have chosen the latest educational technologies to serve solving common problems facing most refugees in the host countries. Using the online volunteering platform, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and hologram, in other words, thinking inside of many boxes and linking them to solve the currents problems.]*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*[During the prototyping face, we learned how to make things more user friendly and how we can put ourselves in the shoes of the end user.]*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*[Our intended users for testing are refugees students, refugees that doesn't have the opportunity to access schools. Our project main added value and point of strength is that can be applied with any language (Turkish, Arabic, English, French...) and can be used by university students.]*
