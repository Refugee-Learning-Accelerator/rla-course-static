Description:

These AI concepts, allow learning foreign languages outside and even inside the schools and especially during social life. This happen using the mobile camera to scan our environment and to suggest social expressions in the Turkish, Arabic and English languages, moreover, allowing the user to hear the expression, so she/he can try speaking the language and its related accent.
Furthermore, creating booklets, comic strip or stories for different levels, allowing scanning via the mobile some pictures, to get the needed AI animations that support learning languages through advising the shape … and coloring of the characters and what they are doing in different languages. The scope of the project can be divided into 2 phases: Social AR, AR Stories.

Questions:

- What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve?

•	The Social AR will solve the language barrier for the refugee that is blocking their integration in the hosting countries.
•	The AR stories, will allow for the student and others to build a strong language helping them smoothly get engaged with their school and university studies, in addition to making the complex scientific concepts easier to be understood.
 
- How will the AR experience solve it?

•	The Social AR will generate suggestions on what to say for each social situation, allowing the user to interact with her/his environment. Refer to the Social AR section in the .pdf attached.
•	The AR Stories will generate AR animation for specific pages in the story allowing the user to learn new vocabularies, verbs in addition to the grammatical rules.

- Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Both applications, Social AR and AR Stories, can be used by any age range and education level including illiterate, school and university refugee students. The user shall be engaged through exciting stories, and for the children through fascinating creative and colored animations, characters and personalities.

- What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context?

The applications require only a mobile device. For the stories we need to develop a specific booklet. I believe this is realistic as long as the refugees have smart phones and we have the needed budget to develop the needed booklets.

- What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?
Social and Self Educational activities are facilitated by the AR experience, which will reduce dramatically the number of illiterate and 

- What challenges do you expect to encounter?
My main challenges are related to the lack of technical expertise and the cost of development, in addition to open the required relations with the donors.
