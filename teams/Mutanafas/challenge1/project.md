## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

We used the following technology to build our Chabot prototype:
   - Nodejs
   - Facebook messenger api
   - heroku cloud hosting
   - Facebook page


### What challenges did you face?

    - We had problem in creating Facebook application and add roles for our team members
    - We had problem with SSL connection for Messenger api but using heroku cloud hosting helped us to fix it.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

 - Best thing about Chabot is the automation. The system responds 24/7 without any need for a human intervention or assistance.
- In addition, our Chatbot treats a very well needed taboo topic, and presents a solution to many suffering children.
Moreover, it is not only a learning tool but it also include a reporting section which is something special in a Chatbot.


### What would you different in the future? 

 We have to keep on researching for the latest technologies and how to integrate Artificial Intelligence APIs.

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

 Our next step is to link our chatbot with ML systems to improve the quality of the answers. So we think the coding part will be new and interesting.
