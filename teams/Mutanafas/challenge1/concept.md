# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

Our concept emerged out of different ideas that we discussed as a team, which cover a broad range of topics related to refugee learning. We want to address the questions of access to education, contacts between refugee students and potential volunteers as well as NGOs, therapeutic assistance, traumatic stress disorders, mental health counseling, sexual abuse, and peace-making. Broadly speaking, our conceptual approach is to envision refugee learning together with questions of mental health. We chose to develop a chatbot on abuse - a question that is highly taboo in refugee communities - in order to provide a safe space for victims to learn about physical and sexual abuse as well as peace education. The project will work toward avoiding cycles of abuse over generations.

The chatbot aims at guiding victims of abuse in getting assistance and dealing with events of violence while helping them report their cases, defend themselves, and get therapeutic, social, and legal support. It consists of three parts: physical education, sexual education, and peace education. First, the AI guidance will help them understand and identify events of physical and sexual abuse. The unfolding interaction will prompt users, either students or parents, to open up while learning how to defend themselves and identify cases of abuse.  Second, the chatbot will connect users to a network of health professionals and social workers offering them both psychological and legal support in their country of residence. Last, the users will be given an opportunity to learn about human rights education, conflict resolution, and team building.  

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

The chatbot will tackle the challenge of physical and sexual abuse, which are profoundly taboo subjects among refugee youths. Additionally, it will offer them knowledge about peace-making and peace education. 

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

The chatbot will increase the studentsâ€™ awareness of the stakes of abuse and help them identify cases. It will serve as both a learning and prevention tool, and a safe haven for victims to share their cases and seek psychological and legal support.  

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary users of the Mutanafas chatbot will be students and parents. Other users will include NGOs, health and legal professionals. 

<b>Engagements</b>

    - Teaching students how to be peace leaders in their communities and how to promote dialogue, peace, and love.
    - Raising awareness about sexual and physical abuse, and teaching how to defend themselves.
    - Enabling volunteers that would like to help raise awareness about the above topics.
    - Enabling students to report sexual abuse and violent incidents, and to get the right care.


### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The chatbot will facilitate the process of identification of abuse, which will be easier with a chatbot platform than through human interactions. It will enable victims to locate and get connected with relevant organizations that can help. 

The chatbot will also help refugee youths to be committed to peace and to confront violent and extremist ideologies. 


### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

We expect to encounter a number of challenges regarding cost, equipment, and tools. Ethical and legal issues related to the protection of privacy should also be addressed. One of the challenges we expect to face is also the different cultural conceptions of abuse and reticence towards sexual education.
