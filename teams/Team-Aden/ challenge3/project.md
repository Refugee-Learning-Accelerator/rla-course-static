### What challenges did you face?

*[1-The AR new technology and new platform with new programming language that we haven't used before.
The difficulty of connecting to the internet in the last period, which led to the choice of AR, and we could not complete the finalization 
2-There was a shortcoming of us in the inclusion of some videos, pictures and illustrations and it was because of the situations that pass
Where (Yemen) of the continuous interruption in electricity and the Internet and around us as much as possible to interact with you and complete some of the challenges for a weekly.
3-One of the most important problems is the lack of refugees in our city, which led to the lack of knowledge of the main problem they face in education and hope to allow us the opportunity to meet them closely and know the main problems in education and the appropriate solution for them.
We are very excited to continue working and build a successful and integrated project.]*
