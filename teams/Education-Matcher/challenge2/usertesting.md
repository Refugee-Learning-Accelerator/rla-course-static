# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

We carefully chose our test users in order to receive useful and advantageous feedback. Each member of our team contacted any potential user they know and through them, reached out to more people.

Our primary users were people who worked closely with refugees and were concerned with their education. Aya Abo El Zelof is an impressive AUB student who used to teach the English Language for Syrian refugees who were aged between 18 and 24 in order to help them in college or work. She worked with Jusoor the NGO. She gladly went through our Facebook prototype page and gave her feedback listed below.

Dana Abed is Dima's sister and a communication expert who has studied Media at the American University of Beirut (AUB) and is working there. She therefore is well familiar with the way such Facebook pages have to be properly, efficiently, and professionally managed. She took the time to check our page out.

Omar El Rifai is also a Syrian AUB student who is not a refugee but very concerned with their matters and involved in many clubs whose aim are to provide better life to refugees.

Josee Aoun and Dimitri Saad are both university students who have always been concerned with education and its importance. They have a vision of how we can help anyone and especially refugees with education and they understand its urgency.  They gave constructive criticism and suggestions to make the page better.

We have also received very useful ideas from Shereen Messi, Mohamad, and Florian Muller on Gitlab, who are all working on improving the learning experience for refugees in the MIT refugee learning accelerator.

### What was the setting of the test? 

Since our prototype was a public Facebook page and not something done with tangible material for example, the setting of the test was mainly online. We would call the users and ask them if they can check the page out and give feedback, and if they respond positively we would share with them the link through Facebook Messenger, and they would get back to us with some comments, impressions, and suggestions. 

We made sure not to tell them what the page's purpose is before they check it out themselves. We wanted to test the clarity of it and see whether they would understand the main idea on their own, since we would not be there next to every user later on and explain to them. They would naturally scroll through it, understanding that it’s just a prototype with only sample posts and stories.

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

The main points of the feedback we received were:

- Right identification of the problem especially for the refugees in Lebanon. While a lot of them suffer and feel hopeless, there are others working (illegally, but still), studying or even helping others. Getting them to inspire the rest is a good idea.
- The proposed solution is elegant and simple. No coding, no big resources required, just finding the right people and getting their story out. In addition, using a Facebook page is a good option for the targeted users especially that they are already using it.
- The name of the page is misleading and is not reflecting the content and the target of the page. It doesn’t translate well to Arabic, and it is too general.
- The videos and posts much be short, precise and concise; maximum of 2 mins for a video and 10 lines for a post.
- At the end of each post, add contact info to the person telling the story to make it easier for other refugees to contact him.
- In the current prototype, we must scroll down in order to understand the purpose of the page, especially that the posts are various. The "About" page must be updated and a small description of the page should be added.
- Include a small description at the beginning of each post in order to attract the page visitors, more like a clickbait, but an authentic one. For example, "from a poor family seeking refuge 5 years ago to a senior writer in a company". This way, the scrolling process becomes more enjoyable and leads people to click on what catches their attention.
- Due to political reasons, options for refugees in Lebanon are very limited, especially the right to work. Need to make sure to check out UN protection standards when it comes to privacy of the "examples” the page will highlight. 
- Meet and talk with as many NGO staff as possible. 
- Make a map of ongoing free trainings and homework help classes to link potential users to them. 

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

Based on the received feedback, we will do the following:

- Change the name, profile picture and cover photo of the page to be more personalized and reflective.
- Add a description to the page.
- Summarize the existing post and make sure from now on to have concise posts and videos.
- Contact more people working with refugees to get further feedback to improve the page.
- Contact real refugees and start collecting success stories.
- Check UN protection standards concerning privacy of the persons the page is highlighting.
- Contact NGOs and collaborate with them to share successful stories from their projects, as well as free trainings they are offering, scholarships, and workshops.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Learning about the Human Centered Design opened our eyes to many elements that we should take into consideration while designing and prototyping a solution. What was especially new to us is the importance of sketching. Since most of our team members are engineering students we are used to write bullet points while brainstorming and then develop our project. We were positively surprised by the insight and clarity that sketching brought to our vision. Seeing shapes and drawings rewired our brains and brought more life and emotions into our brainstorming.  Another thing that was new to us is one of the techniques adopted in the Human Centered Design process. We liked the example given by Tracee of her friend who actually checked herself as a patient when she was designing a solution for hospitals. So going to where our users are and trying to live their experiences instead of just interviewing them should allow us to notice things that we might have missed and that would help enhance the development of our solution.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

As we went through the different stages of the Human Centered Design cycle we found that the two most useful parts were the "synthesize" and "feedback". We think that it is very important to be able to filter the data we receive from our users in a way that we narrow the information down to only what would be helpful and useful for the design of our solution. The “feedback” stage is also crucial since it puts the solution developed in the hands of the intended users for testing. Therefore, on the one hand it will tell us if we were successful in solving parts of the problem (or the integrity of the problem); and on the other hand it will allow us to pinpoint the elements that we should optimize or even the features that we should add to improve our solution.
