# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

We would like to bring emotional support for refugees to motivate them to believe in themselves and have the courage to pursue their dreams. To do so we have created a Facebook page which we name "شعاع أمل لسوريا - Ray of Hope for Syria". We chose this solution because on the one hand, many opportunities are opening for Syrian refugees in Lebanon; but on the other hand many refugees don’t find the courage to even apply or try to seize these opportunities because they think they don’t stand a chance or have what it takes which is not true.

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

To check our prototype please go the the following Facebook page: شعاع أمل لسوريا - Ray of Hope for Syria

Link: https://www.facebook.com/RayofHopeForSyria/

We have added screenshots from our facebook page as well as a short video to better present it.

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

Our prototype is a Facebook page named "شعاع أمل لسوريا - Ray of Hope for Syria" whose aim is to share stories of Syrian refugees in Lebanon who have managed to success in different areas. The refugees will be telling their own stories describing the challenges that they faced and how they overcame them. The page will also be a place to share events and posts that could help the Syrian refugees seek a better future such as programming workshops, scholarship opportunities. As a prototype, we have added one story of a successful syrian girl who has studied and got her degree in lebanon. The story is not real but is made of for the sake of prototyping and do not refer to any real person. We have added also one event on a workshop that introduces the participants to the IELTS exam which is required in many universities. The content of the page will be updated and we will start adding real stories for refugees either as posts or short videos as well as events and workshops once we get enough feedback on the prototype. The profile picture and the cover photo of the page will be updated as well based again on the received feedback in the next phase.

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

During this prototyping process we learned not to assume what our users need or try to come up with solutions that we believe are necessary. We learnt that we should start by asking the users what they need or contacting someone who works with them and could tell us what they consider as a priority and what they perceive as secondary or less urgent needs.

### Who are your intended users for testing?

We will test our prototype with our friends and families first but our main intended users are Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon. Therefore, we started by contacting the Syrian club at our university (American University of Beirut) and we got from them contacts of several people working with NGOs that address refugees needs and problems. Our next step is to interacte directly with real syrian refugees and get feedback from them on our prototype.
