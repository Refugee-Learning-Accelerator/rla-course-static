# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

For the first challenge, we came up with the concept of a chatbot that we're calling "Ustaz Fahmi" to serve both refugees students and teachers. Ustaz Fawzi's main purpose is to make it easy for students who need tutoring or help in a certain subject at school to find a suitable teacher. It is common for refugees to find it difficult to find a tutor that suits them, for example, cost and location wise. Nevertheless, many people who are willing and able to help are available, but don’t know where to start or how to help. Ustaz Fahmi is a useful link between these people and students that need tutoring sessions. Each time a student requests help, Ustaz Fahmi asks him for contact information and specific tutoring needs (material, number of sessions...) and provides him with several tutors options based on his specifications. Similarly, when a tutor contacts Ustaz Fahmi, he must provide his contact information and teaching preferences (material, level of students, session duration…) and Ustaz Fahmi will give him the list of students requesting help and matching his preferences.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

Ustaz Fahmi’s primary purpose is to support primary, middle and high school students in their education. 

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

Ustaz Fahmi will play the role of a virtual tutor implemented on Facebook Messenger.  It will take primary data from the user and then suggest links, apps and even give the student the option to contact a real tutor. The data gathered will basically be the grade, subject and option to type the question for the student. The tutors on the other hand will supply their names, grades and subjects they teach and their contact numbers. The tutoring sessions could be arranged by meeting or simply by video call on Messenger; students could sign up for a session individually or in a group. Ustaz Fahmi will also suggest links to online libraries where students can download relevant references and listen to free audiobooks. Finally, Ustaz Fahmi will be available in both Arabic and English.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary user is the student. It will engage the students by applying the fun to learn concept and showing them that their questions could be answered in a simple way. It will also motivate them to keep using the chatbot through a fun design with friendly and motivating texts. The secondary users are the tutors who could range from teachers, college students to any qualified person willing to give tutoring sessions at convenient prices for refugees. We would most certainly encourage refugees who already got their high school degree to join the tutor branch since they would set an example and be the living proof that with hard work and perseverance failure or giving up is not an option.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

Due to the limited number of schools for refugees the classes are crowded reaching 45 students per class. Therefore, the teacher could not follow individually students. Moreover, most parents have not completed their school degree which means that they would not be able to help tackle and solve their children’s weaknesses at school. In addition, tutors are expensive. Therefore, many students fail to work and solve their weaknesses at school which makes them unmotivated to learn and they end up dropping school at grade 6 or 9 in order to seek some poorly paid job or even get married. Ustaz Fahmi will accompany them through their education and offer tutoring sessions at a convenient price. It would also hopefully create some job opportunities or supply a modest income for tutors.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

We expect to mainly encounter two challenges. The first is in the coding, sorting, storing and retrieving the data from databases. The second is in the translation and making the chatbot available in both Arabic and English.
