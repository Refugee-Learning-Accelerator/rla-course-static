Mockups and diagrams are attached to better describe our concept for this challenge.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

Since refugees’ main burden in foreign countries is language, the AR experience’s main goal will be to develop the language speaking and writing skills of refugees who do not have time or facilities to learn them at school or in official courses. The AR experience will combine the process of learning new words and translating Arabic to the language of the hosting countries, with the process of building sentences and learning the grammar and correct structures of sentences that can be built with those words. 

In summary, the challenges that the AR experience will solve the issue of integrating Arabic speaking refugees in English speaking (or where education is in English) countries by:

- Acquiring words and names of specific objects in English
- Getting to know the correct pronunciation of these words 
- Learning correct sentence structure 
- Enhancing writing skills in use of words, grammar, and spelling 


### How will the AR experience solve it? 

We have thought of combining many concepts together to optimize the AR experience and make the best of it. We will list each concept apart.

1. The first idea is to build an application with Unity, where it will be able to recognize objects through the phone’s camera. Upon recognition, the application gives the name of the object in both English and Arabic, and playing a voice record of the word in English (similar to the voice engine in Google translate, for example). 
What kind of objects? We have decided to make many modules that should be selected before starting to use the application for the object recognition. This will facilitate the process of recognition. For each module, we would have given the app models of possible objects that could be asked, as many as we can think of, and associate the correct words. The app would later on see the resemblance between the user's object and the pre-integrated object by us (the developers) and give the answer. Examples of modules: Roads (including vehicles, signs, billboards, stations, etc.), school components (book, pen, desk, etc.), pets, house components (furniture, kitchen tools, etc.), clothes (pant/shirt/jacket/shoes/etc.), and many others. 
2. The second idea is the game part. We will need the use of a spelling and grammar engine, such as Grammarly or Ginger, to be integrated in this part. We will think of ways of linking such engine to the application.  After having asked for a bunch of words, the user has now to build a sentence using those words. When done, the spelling and grammar engine (let us assume Grammarly for now) will correct the sentence as it usually does and give a score. Grammarly can check the grammar, spelling, vocab, and structure. Based on the score the user gets, they can either unlock a new module or repeat the same step until they get a score that is good enough. 


### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

Primary users are student refugees who live in English speaking countries (or need English for education) and who already use a smartphone (preferably Android phone) and can be connected to the internet. They can also be regular users (adults or non-students) who are enthusiastic to enhancing their English language skills and cannot learn it at school/courses. 
The AR experience will engage the user though the application. We are still not sure if we can make it entirely offline or we will always need some internet signal.  The application will be both fun and educational and should keep the user’s interest.

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

The user needs to have an Android phone to be able to download the app. As we have discussed in earlier seminars this is part of the everyday technology tools available to the refugees so our project is applicable in the refugee context. 

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

Our AR experience allows the user to learn English by engaging on an educational adventure and discovering the world around him/her through his/her phone camera. As a Lebanese citizen living in a country where people speak two languages at least and being a student who has learnt five languages I can say with confidence that the best way to learn and practice a language is by integrating this language in our everyday life activities. And this is exactly what the AR experience will allow considering that most refugees use their phones on a daily basis then engaging on this educational journey should be fun and exciting and would bring very little change in their behavioral mode which increases the likelihood of adoption of this technology. 

### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

We expect to mainly face two challenges: linking grammarly to the app and attaching audio to the images.
