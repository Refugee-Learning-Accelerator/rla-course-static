# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Our chatbot, Hakeem, can respond to patients and inquisitive refugees who want to learn about health via Facebook Messenger. Hakeem can also update a physician or health advocate on the backend about a patient’s condition based on their messaging, thus enabling realtime patient monitoring.*

*In the case of a sick patient as demonstrated, Hakeem will ask questions to determine exactly what is the patient’s condition. The patient is not limited to the answers shown in the chatbot.*

*Hakeem will also send an email to the relevant administrators when the patient updates via chat.*

*Hakeem will follow-up on the patient’s condition and check on him automatically at a set interval.*

*Hakeem can also be used for general informational and educational purposes by leveraging professionally edited open-access medical resources like medscape.*

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?


*We used Chatfuel to implement a simple diagnostic tree. We created some basic “AI rules” to redirect different but highly related user inputs to the same response block.*




### What challenges did you face?

*We found it challenging to link Facebook Messenger to localhost. It was one of the motivations of using Chatfuel.*



### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

*We like how it automatically checks in with a sick patient periodically.*

### What would you different in the future? 

<<<<<<< HEAD
*We would not rely on an out-of-the-box platform like Chatfuel. Although it allows for quick prototyping, it has some limitations including:*

*Sub-par phrase/sentence recognition: e.g. it cannot recognize that “hello” and “hello doctor” mean the same thing.*

*Inability to generate responses automatically.*

*Tedious work when there are a lot of conditions.*

*In future iterations, we would use Arabic instead of English to be of maximal use to our mainly Arabic-speaking refugee user base.*

*We would rely less on a hardcoded binary symptom tree, and instead build an intelligent probablistic diagnostic model that can handle all symptoms, and asks the appropriate question given the patient’s condition.*

*We will also build a backend for medical doctors and organizational health support staff to view patient status.*
