# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

*Our chatbot will serve as an artificially intelligent medical diagnostic and informational platform. The interface with the patient will be natural and simple: the patient will conversationally input their symptomatology and the chatbot will output patient education information, crucial health-related alerts, and treatment options. The patient will be able to continually converse with the chatbot throughout their management; the chatbot can periodically check in with the patient to monitor their progress. The data input by the patient will be organized and analyzed on the back-end to integrate with and improve our chatbot’s conversational ability and recommendations. We will also present the data and relevant recommendations to providers through a second interface.*

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

*Patients in the refugee population have limited access to clinical doctors. Organizations delivering care have limited data on patient outcomes and disease monitoring. Patient knowledge of their own chronic conditions can be severely limited in the refugee care setting. Furthermore, many patients may be unaware of acute conditions they are experiencing, and the urgency with which they should receive care.*

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

*The chatbot will provide relevant information to the patient’s condition and care. It can also provide information about health conditions the user has observed in others, thereby generating greater community health awareness.*

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

*The primary user is any refugee needing medical information with access to the internet. The chatbot will live in Facebook Messenger or as a standalone mobile app. The patient can initiate conversation at any time, and the default setting of the chatbot will be to periodically check in with the patient at a frequency dependent on their condition.*

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

* Our chatbot will be a free and readily accessible avenue for many refugees to directly receive information pertaining to their health. Our chatbot will also facilitate monitoring of individual patients, and analyzing health data in aggregate, via a second interface for healthcare providers and organizational care-managers.*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

* We expect that developing this chatbot in Arabic will present additional challenges since the relevant vectorized dictionaries are less developed than English. We can overcome this challenge by leveraging machine learning approaches and expert labeling to create the necessary dictionaries. Gathering the initial clinical data to train the diagnostic tree underlying our chatbot will be a challenge. We will attempt to partner with non-profit organizations to obtain this data. *
