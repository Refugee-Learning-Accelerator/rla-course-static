# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*We are testing a prototype for an educational game called Epimedic that teaches refugee students about healing related topics.*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*See here to use prototype chatbot: https://www.facebook.com/Hakeem-350875762044384*

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*We chose to implement this as a chatbot where the user dynamically decides the path to take along a branched story line because it is an interactive format that makes learning fun. From a prototype development standpoint, we can rapidly edit the gameplay as compared to graphics-intensive games.*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*We learned about how important it is to consider the user when designing a UI. For example, we discussed how to handle mental health related topics, for which we will need to develop educational materials and present them in a  sensitive and intelligent manner to reach our audience appropriately, especially in a game-style application.*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*Our intended users are young Syrian refugees living in a camp environment interested in learning about health and improving the health of their communities.*
