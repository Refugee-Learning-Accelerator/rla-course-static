### How did you select your test users? 

*Family and Friends*

### What was the setting of the test? 

*Our users logged in on Facebook Messenger from their mobile phones and tested the chatbot without any instruction or direction from the developers.*

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*All of our users suggest we change language to be less formal and more personal. We need to introduce more clarity between the different facets of the app (education versus diagnostics/help). One of our users suggested to add illustrations, which we plan to do. Our text sometimes does not fit on a single screen, resulting in a need to swipe, which can be frustrating for the users. Similarly, we need to use open source information integrated into the app, instead of linking out so much to relatively complicated sources that might overwhelm the user.*

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*Facebook Messenger was a great quick way to showcase our idea, but lacked the ability to demonstrate features that are going to be present in the final product. Based on the project feedback, these features will be incorporated and consolidated illustrations, ability to choose the ?game? to be played, or a random ?game,? choose a topic.*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*The whole ?Human Centered Design? process was new to us. But while it is similar to other design processes, the first part of the design process - Inspiration Phase - was particularly new and interesting.*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*Being engineers/scientists, we always tackled the problem in a technical way: ?Ok, this is the problem, how can I solve it?? We never thought about putting ourselves in the user?s shoes from the beginning, and instead generally skipped directly to the ?Ideation Phase?, while keeping in mind that the solution must be ?user-friendly?. But while this approach can work in purely technical problems, when dealing with more human-centered problems, we were convinced that it is necessary to not only take the potential users? input into consideration, but probably even base our solution on that. This is particularly true for the refugee learning problem, but it can also be true - to a lesser extent - to any solution involving human interaction.*
