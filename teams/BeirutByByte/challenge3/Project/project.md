# Challenge 3 Final Project

## Description

We had a few changes from the previous idea
* We want to make the app a bit more interactive so instead of phrases we used videos
* The video has sample phrases he can learn
* These phrases can be translated in the app and replayed each alone
* Focused on a bite-sized learning approach. On every new return, he would get a new lesson every time

How the scenario would go
1. User turns on his Bluetooth
2. User gets a Notification on his phone that there is a learning opportunity
3. User opens the App and the AR experience begins
4. User looks for the targeted symbol and scans it
5. User watches a video of a related dialogue
6. Video ends and the app goes to a transcript to the dialogue that just happened
7. User clicks on each line and hears the line again and gets the Arabic translation for it
8. User can then switch to AR camera and find more symbols

You can check the demo for the app here:

*Please make sure to turn on English subtitles for a more pleasant viewing*

directly download it from the repository in the [Demo Video folder](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/tree/master/challenge3/Project/Demo%20Videos)

## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

Unity and Android Studio. We used AR Vuforia and a sample video playback project.

### What challenges did you face?

* A limited internet connection and packages that were sometimes over a GB in size.
* Learning Unity.
* Integrating the Unity Project into Android Studios
* Getting the Bluetooth Notification to work

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best?

It's quite simple to implement with Vuforia. You just need to adapt to the environment and workflow. The AR gives quite an immersive experience. It's very fascinating to see things being altered and augmented. We really started seeing how these kind of experiences could make lessons more enjoyable and more relatable.

### What would you different in the future?

We did face a few problems and there were a few things we wished we had the chance to finish or in the very least integrate into the
* Due to a few compilation errors, we were not able to build the Unity project or export it into Android studio. In the future, the AR and the Android app would be in one application on the users phone.
* We would also have wanted to add a place where he could see the video again in his inventory. We don't want the user to go every time into AR mode to see the video.
* Do more than one video for the same concept in order to show the bite-sized learning approach. That way when the user comes another day and scans again he gets another lesson.
* To show you the recordings of the different phrases in the app. You can see the recordings [here](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/tree/master/challenge3/Project/Audio%20files%20Each%20line).
* An instruction page that would dictate how the user would use the app and how it works.
* To show a proper demo with an actual Bluetooth beacon and an actual register.



### Please also add a link to your code!
Due to huge packages and the very limited internet connection we could not upload the code to GitLab. However, we would like to mention that the AR project is based on the following git repository below:
https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/BBBARUnity

This was the very early version of the AR App. We later on had to add a lot of extra libraries and code. The App then became over half a GB and uploading proved to be quite a hassle.

You could see the raw videos
* ***Register Files:*** These are in the [register  folder](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/tree/master/challenge3/Project/Register%20Video). It includes the script, the srt, the video, and the celtx file
* ***Demo Files***: These are in the [Demo Video folder](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/BeirutByByte/team-template/tree/master/challenge3/Project/Demo%20Videos). Due to the size, this folder only includes links to files on YouTube or on google drive. It also includes the final Demo video along with its srt file.
