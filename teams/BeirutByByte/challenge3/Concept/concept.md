# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description



The concept is very similar to a catch them All theme. The user needs to get as much phrases as he can from the real world.

The scenario would go like this

  1. User goes into a location with a Bluetooth beacon
  2. User gets a notification on his phone about possible new _phrases_ in the area
  3. User go finds dedicated _QR codes_ or _stickers_.
  4. User gets AR on the _QR codes_ or _stickers_ of the phrases. Theses phrases would be relevant to the location he/she is in.
  5. User collects them to his/her inventory.$

$: The solution can support a flashcard creation for later revisions & exercises out of the AR context.

Limitations: We tried to keep the following in mind
* Ability to be used on an Android phone
* Low reliance on GPS and mobile Data
* Ability to learn later and not in the augmented reality necessarily.
* Promote the user to go out and engage with the world.


This idea was actually a combination of both solutions introduced during the weekly seminars and an article for the walk-through:
* [Salsa](http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/salsa/)
* Basr unity project 
* [AR Code article](https://medium.com/arjs/ar-code-a-fast-path-to-augmented-reality-60e51be3cbdf)

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve?

Making Language learning a bit more relatable and embed them into their daily activities. Most language learning happen in a classroom environment and they usually go very slow and they really go into the knots and bolts. Sometimes users just want to know what expression they can use in a certain circumstance and instance.

Making Language learning available to those who are already out of the educational system and seeking jobs, with fully-booked days trying to earn a living. AR will allow them to keep on moving towards where ever they are going, yet still learning on the way there.

### How will the AR experience solve it?

Learners will have a more realistic approach to learning the language and can really get some phrases and vocab that are most relevant to their daily experiences/routine.

AR will allow refugees to keep on moving towards where ever they are going, yet still learning on the way there rather than pausing and dedicating time for language learning.

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

The primary users would be refugees in a foreign country where they wouldn't know the native language or the ones that are planning to relocate to countries where they don't know the native language.

For example, a refugee could enter a train station and he would get a trigger on his phone telling him he could *catch a few phrases here*. He would take out his phone find the relevant stickers and save these phrases in his/her inventory. He could then go to a more private location and learn these phrases on his/her own pace. These phases could be "I would like to buy a ticket?", "Where is the restroom?", and etc ...

The application could also be used in Refugee camps such as the Al Zaâ€™atari Refugee Camp where refugees do 5km walk from and to school. This would help them learn on the way while requiring minimum infrastructure from the refugee camp.

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context?

All they would need is an android phone. This phone would hopefully also be Bluetooth enabled specifically with BLE technology so the battery would last the whole day with it on.

The area/locations would have to be equipped with Bluetooth beacons.

The user would not always require a internet connection to play. A phone would trigger only phrases from a database located on his/her phone. The database could be updated when the app is updated or when the user has an internet connection.

It would also require some NGOs to insert and check up on the QR-codes/Stickers in the area.

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?

This would allow users to learn phrases specific to their routines and habits. These would be the phrases that are most useful to them. It would also promote them to engage, explore, and more importantly practice what they learned. 

Learning on the fly, instead of dedicating a block of time for language learning.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?
None of us has experience with AR or unity so this would be a challenge to learn a new technology and develop something with our limited skills.

In addition:
- Mis-usage of QR-codes /Stickers.
- Not finding the stickers.
- Ability to bring new content constantly & keep the user engaged
