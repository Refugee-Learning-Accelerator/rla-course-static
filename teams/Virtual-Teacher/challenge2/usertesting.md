# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

*[The majority of our test users were the refugees who rapidly came all the way from Kirkuk, due to the unfortunate circumstances. For the other part of our test users, we asked our colleagues, friends and family.]*
### What was the setting of the test? 

*[The setting of the test was done by showing them our app, asking the users about their opinions, asking for a feedback, focusing on the way they had used it and trying to check if there was any errors during the processing. On the other hand, we put some content on the app for a better understading and to make them feel like they are dealing with real fully functional app.]*
### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*[The main points of the feedback we received were that the user liked the purpose of the application and what problem it encountered but they didn't like the user interface as they found it to be a bit too complicated. They also mentioned how the application lacked the information of which specific camp their donations would be delivered to. Other than that, the user was excited to see a finished version.]*

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*[The changes that we would make to our project is to simplify the user interface to make it easier for the user to use and to provide the information of which camp their donations would be delivered to.]*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*[Doing research and watching people, recording their interaction with asking lots of questions. And have in-depth discussion with your team. Seeing the patterns that begin to appear, what do people like and what do they dislike. And how can you make a product that makes a real difference in their lives.]*
### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*[The ability to put yourself in the shoes of another person and see the world from their perspective was an enlightening experience and helped in shaping a product that is made for the user, and not what you think the user wants since in reality a product should actually be useful to the person who is going to be using it.]*
