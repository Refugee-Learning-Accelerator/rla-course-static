# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

When you give donations you’ll get feedback either live as they received it or pictures or videos of them receiving and thanking the donator.
The app would also show what the refugees need as they can request what is needed for refugees, it could be either requested by the refugees themselves if they have internet or by the camp management.
There would be 2 ways for the goods be delivered to the refugees: 
1) either NGOs that are looking for donations from people can collect and deliver the goods.
2) You would personally deliver the goods as the app could show you directions.


### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*[Providing a better way to facilitate donations from people who are willing to donate to refugees and those that are need of help and connecting NGOs who want donations to give to refugees with people who give donations. The number of refugees is increasing every day and their very basic wants and needs are increasing every day such as clothes and their daily life supplements, and on the other hand, a lot of people want to make donations for the refugees but don't know how to deliver them through what mediums and channels.]*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

*[The application would work as a platform to connect refugees with people who want to donate and NGOs that are looking to get donations to provide to refugees. Basically, this application will have to types of options, the first one is that you submit whatever you want to donate and when there is the need for that thing, your donation will be taken, and the second one is that you go and look at the list of required goods. When you give donations you'll get feedback either live as they received it or pictures or videos of them receiving and thanking the donation. The app would also show what the refugees need as they can request what is needed for refugees, it could be either requested by the refugees themselves if they have internet or by the camp management. There would be 2 ways for the goods be delivered to the refugees: 1. either NGOs that are looking for donations from people can collect and deliver the goods. 2. You would personally deliver the goods as the app could show you directions.]*

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*[We decided to use the interactive wireframe to help us better express the idea and to make it more tangible and to show the bigger image.]*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*[Through this challenge, we learned how to make a mock-up prototype using Mock plus. We learned in order to find a solution for a problem, we need to empathize with the user and find where their problems are originating from and finding all the players that are involved in this issue and involving them in the final solution and even help turn the players into possible beneficiaries.]*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*[There’s a new torrent of refugees in KRI that are IDPs that are displaced from Kirkuk a neighboring province, these refugees aren’t living in camps but are living in temporary housing. Who are in desperate needs of clothes and goods, on the other hand, a lot of people are willing to make donations. And we'll test the application out by giving the prototype to both sides.]*
