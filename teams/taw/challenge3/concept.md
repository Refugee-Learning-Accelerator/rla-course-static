Our team has experimented (AR) with the field of technology education for refugees and we have used first-hand applications such as Aurasma to understand the virtual reality that is not effective in our society despite the use of advanced technology, but this is an opportunity to imagine and simplify some of the concepts that belong to the field of computer and this is a beautiful experience and purposeful and fun to interact with content Education.
What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 
We try to solve the problem of understanding, simplifying and interacting with the content definition of internal and external computer components, and conveying a simple concept to refugee definition with enhanced virtual reality and its application in various fields
How will the AR experience solve it?
We have downloaded some enhanced virtual reality applications and created and applied technology content
 
Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

The basic users who will implement it are learners who want to learn technology from refugees
What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 
The most thighs we need to Appalachian  of (AR) is smartphone and tap to use,I think it good to apply the  (AR) on learners from refugees it's help to understand the the idea of technology and it's help to interactive between them. 
What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 
One of the most important activities facilitated by the use of (AR) is an interaction that happens to understand some components that are difficult to explain. For example, in the definition of the components of the internal computer we were able to use (AR) to get a clearer picture of the components and simplify them more
 

What challenges do you expect to encounter?

We apply the  (AR) and find the most challenge is limited hardware that can use in.

How did you build it?
We used the Aurasma Appalachian to apply (AR)
What challenges did you face?
We find the challenges to use unity program 
What aspect of the AR experience do you like best? 
We create a new apply used the context technology 
What would you different in the future? 
To be able to use the unity program better and apply it on a wide scale
