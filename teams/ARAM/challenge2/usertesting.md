# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

As our prototype aims to help syrian refugees in Lebanon to overcome the problem of the language and enable them to shift their educational background from Arabic to English, we tried to choose a sample of users who resembles the situation of the syrian refugees in Lebanon. We chose the freshmen in the faculty of computer science and information system, Thamar university, the college which we work in. They encounter the problem of the language as well since the education system in secondary schools in Yemen is totally based on Arabic unlike the educational system in univeristies which is mostly based on English.

### What was the setting of the test? 

We chose some students and even members of the family and sent them the application to their own phones. We asked them to test the application and provide us feedback without any intervention or guidance from us.

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

Most of the feedback suggested to enrich the content with more categories and subjects. Also some students urged the needness of such apps that helps freshmen with difficulties that face them in their first days in university. One of the useful feedback from a user who is not used to technology was to make an explanatory tutorial on how to use the application. On the other hand, a professional user to technology stated that the application is self-explanatory, also he suggested us to provide the application with the zoom feature to enable any page to be zoomed in and out.

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

One of the important changes is to complete the work we started and enrich the application with more categories and subjects. Also to solve the issue of compatibility which encountered some users and prevented them from using the application.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

Most parts of the Human Centered Design process were known to us but without realizing that. But in the session we learned how to make this process the correct way step by step.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

All of the Human Centered Design process are of paramount importance, but the "Empathize" step is the most useful one for us, which will determine how the following steps will be directed.
