# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

An application assistant that helps syrian refugees to learn the most commonly used English terms and sentences  in the Lebanese education system. It helps them to shift their educational background to fit the new educational environment in Lebanon. We choose this issue as it is a main issue not only for syrian refugees, but also for any student who moves from one educational system based on Arabic into another education system based on English, e.g. from high-schools to universities in Yemen.

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

To browse the prototype please check the [prototype folder](https://gitlab.refugeelearning.site/rla/ARAM/team-template/blob/master/challenge2/prototype).

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

The prototype is a wireframe for an application that 
enables students to choose what categories they are 
interested in, then it shows all possible English terms 
and sentences related to this category, that they might face in university classes, paired with Arabic translation and illustrated 
with examples from real-life. 
We have chosen this prototype method for its simplicity, either for us to prototype and also for users to understand. Besides, it gives users and developers a failry complete picture of the application and how it will look like.

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

The prototyping process opened our mind to many aspects realted to the user we are designing for. We learned first the importance of understanding the person/people you are designing for, how to try to make not only one idea but many of them that may meet the user's needs. And to make a trade-off between the available prototyping methods and choose the best applicable one.

### Who are your intended users for testing?

We intend to test the prototype with freshmen in the faculty of computer science and information technology, Thamar university, the university which we work in. We choose these users as they face a similar problem that the syrian refugees in Lebanon face. The suggested users have just left schools in which education system is 
totally based on Arabic, and now enrolled the university in which mostly all classes depend on English.
