# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

We are planning to build an augmented reality application that accelerates the process of language learning for refugee learners. The app can be described as an "Animated Translator" which provides animated translations etched in mind for words that are recognized by the camera.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

The problem of language learning, and the problem of remembering new words. When a user encounters a new word or sentence, he searches a text dictionary and find its meaning. But after a while he forgets the meaning of the word.

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

Traditional dictionaries provide an instant solution when encountring new words, in which the user searches the meaning of these words but forget the meaning after a while. Since most dictionaries are texts, users find difficulties in remembering the words. "A picture is worth one thousand words" it is said, how about an animated one? We are planning to develop an animated dictionary in which translations are provided as animations. This way the probability of forgetting the meaning of words would be highly decreased.

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

The primary users of the suggested app are refugee learners, particularly those  who faces problems in remembering new words.

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

All what users need to use the app is only an android running device supplied with a camera.

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

The suggested app would help refugee learners to accelerate their learning process by providing an effecient means of learning that is based on human perception to visuals. A user would forget a word he has just learned, but he highly unlikey to forget a picture he has seen. however, he would definitely not forget an animation he has just watched.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

As beginners in Unity, we expect to encounter challenges in mastering it to build applications, especially in finding or making suitable animations.
