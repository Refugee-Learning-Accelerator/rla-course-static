## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
The last seminars about chatbots expanded our horizons about chatbots, this resulted in many ideas that came to our minds. As all of our team members are working in the academic field, we encounter many situations in which students suffer in their study which sometimes lead them to drop from their colleges. 
This pushes us into suggesting a chatbot that supports students to choose the specialization that fits their capabilities.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

The problem is that most students have no enough information about specializations when enrolling in universities, besides the difficulty to find resources or people to provide them with suitable information. Moreover, some students are ridiculed when asking for help in some specializations.

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

The suggested chatbot will provide a conversational service for helping students in choosing a suitable specialization by exploring the student's tendencies, flairs, and their educational achievements, and providing them with the information they need about specializations.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The suggested chatbot targets the students who are planning to enroll universities.

The user can interact with the chatbot using text messages. The chatbot will offer the user the services it can do to choose from. The chatbot will respond according to the keywords in the user input. Also the chatbot may show multiple choice modules, yes/no questions… etc.

Initially, we intend to introduce the chatbot to the user as a Messenger app using the Messenger platform. But we are planning to expand our chatbot to use multiple channels to make it a central channel that communicates with the user from different channels, e.g. smooch.io.


### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

Our suggested chatbot will provide students with information they need to choose their specialization based on their personal tendencies.
The chatbot will provide a service to all students that is available 24/7, and with no need for a staff to receive students who seek for information. Also it answers students' question even if they are not related or unrealistic, in a good manner without laughing at them.


### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

There are many challenges that we are expecting to encounter in building our first chatbot. One of them is that, as we are new to such a technology, we would encounter difficulties in dealing with it, especially, "being able to write good chat messages" as Andrew Magliozzi said in his talk. Besides the famous challenges that any chatbot would encounter such as the one that Ola Abu Amsha mentioned about the Arabic language. Also, the NLU difficulties are quite hard to deal with as Alan showed.
