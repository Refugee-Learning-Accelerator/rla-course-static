## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

There were many alternates for building the chatbot, but as starters we preferred to start with the Messenger platform, the Chatfuel platform namely.


### What challenges did you face?

The most difficult step ever is the first step. As this is our first step in building chatbots we faced many challenges. Firstly we tried the DialogFlow of google, but due to not supporting the Arabic language, we had to choose another platform.
We tried the IBM Watson platform which supports the Arabic language. But due to it's difficulty in integration with Facebook Messenger, which we target to access the targeted studetns, we has to move to another platform. We followed the tutorials that you suggested "Messenger Chatbot Tutorial" but we faced many problems since there were many changes in Graph API since the tutorial recording, which led to many problems. We headed to [Chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com) for its simplicity for starters.
However, as programmers with good experience, using chatfuel makes us feel disabled.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best? 

The most interesting thing in the chatbot is its support to both the English and Arabic langueages, besides its simplicity and the way it interacts with the user. 

### What would you different in the future? 

We plan to make our chatbot accessible to every user not only using the facebook messenger, but also as a mobile application that delivers this service to anyone who would get benefit from it.

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

As the chatbot is built using chatfuel, which enables users to build chatbots without writing codes, there is no code to provied.
