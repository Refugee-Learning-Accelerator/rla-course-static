# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

Our challenge1 concept is a chatbot that helps the refugees break the language barrier. Language barrier leaves refugees facing struggle to rebuild their lives, so our chatbot will use a conversational interface that teaches refugees the English language. The chatbot will offer different types of levels from beginner alphabets to sentence structuring and grammar.
One of the main features that would make our chatbot stand out would be the ability for the chatbot to ask you daily questions depending on what you have learned before. For example, after covering the expressions and terms of a typical dinner table conversation, the chatbot would ask the user on the next day what he had for lunch. Later as the user answers the question, the chatbot can examine whether the answer was correct, or wrong. This offers the user the ability to practice his language skills and learn more.


## Questions


### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve?

The chatbot will solve a key problem that most refugees come across with which is the struggle with language barrier.

### How will the chatbot solve it?

Through a conversational interface, the user can learn the English language since it's a universal language. The chatbot will offer a level of English learning courses and will help the refugees move through them slowly and efficiently.

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

The primary user would be any refugee with reading skills, since most of the learning experience would be sentences translated from Arabic to English for a better learning experience. Nonetheless all refugees who are willing to learn a new language and break that language barrier can learn from the chatbot. The chatbot will engage the user by asking daily questions about topics already covered before to check whether the user is successfully learning from the experience.

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?

Firstly, the chatbot will offer a key communication advantage for the refugees. Secondly, it offers free education through an easy to use conversational interface on any device. Finally, through daily questions, it helps the refugees practice their newly acquired skills from the chatbot.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

The main challenge we expect to encounter would be other applications that offer a similar type of service, for example, Duolingo. Another challenge we expect to encounter would be the approach towards educations, as we lack curriculums to teach the English Language.
