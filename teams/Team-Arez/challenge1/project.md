# Challenge 1 Final Project

## Description

Our concept is a chatbot that helps the refugees break the language barrier. Language barrier leaves refugees facing struggle to rebuild their lives, so our chatbot will use a conversational interface that teaches refugees the English language. The chatbot will offer different types of levels from beginner alphabets to sentence structuring and grammar.

On first use, the chatbot would make the user take a test. Based on the results, the chatbot would determine what level the user should start at. As the user progresses with the levels, the chatbot would automatically ask fill in the blank questions daily based on previously studied material. This offers the user the ability to practice his language skills and learn more.

Screenshot_1 demonstrates a Level 1 lesson where the bot translates most of the words to arabic which allows the user to understand more.
Screenshot_2 demonstrates a daily question of a lesson that included the terms and expressions of a dinner table. The questions are not translated at higher levels, but if the user answers wrong, the chatbot would translate it and explain it to the user.
Screenshot_3 shows how new lessons are offered to the user. These lessons would be later asked as daily questions as shown in Screenshot_2.

## Questions

### How did you build it (platform and technology)?

We built it using chatfuel. We created a test page on facebook to test the chatbot and demonstrate how it works.

### What challenges did you face?

The first challenge that we encountered was that chatbot in general is a new technology and it was hard predicting the sequence of the following questions that the user might ask.  Another challenge was the problem of finding the right curriculum to apply in our chatbot. For example, we don't know how to determine the level of difficulty for each stage of learning.

### What aspect of the chatbot do you like best?

The ease of use of the platform is an advantage and a great motivating idea for users to learn.  As well as the use of chatfuel platform offers a complete interface to develop a chatbot without writing a single line of code.

### What would you different in the future?

If we had more time, we would use more advanced platform to develop the chatbot like RASA and integrate deep learning technologies. We would also use Google translate API for translations to help the user understand the questions. Finally we would add a feature that if the bot didn't understand the question, it would offer to search it on Google.

### Are there any parts of your code you'd like to highlight?

Since we used Chatfuel, we didn't have to code anything. Instead, we would like to highlight the use of the automate messages to ask the user a daily question. Daily messages are demonstrated in the screenshots.
