# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

Our test users were mainly neighboring refugee parents.

### What was the setting of the test? 

The setting of the test was a scheduled visit to their house. We offered the users an android tablet to test the solution, and to give us some feedback.

### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

Positive feedback: 
Users found the idea extremely helpful as they shared with us stories of how hard it was for them to choose the right school for their children. Users emphasized on how bias people were towards certain schools when asked for their opinion, while our solution eliminates such opinions. 

Negative feedback:
Most of the users had trouble using the application in English, therefore expressed how helpful it would have been if it had more than one language, especially Arabic.  

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

Based on the feedback, we would make our application available in Arabic. Another thing that we would want to add would be a push notification that would notify users about scholarships and financial aid programs offered by schools. 

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

The human centered design was a whole new process for all of us. It was a unique experience to feel that much empathy with the people we are designing for, and to make us think like them was a huge boost to the process of finding a solution.

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

As we already mentioned, the process of feeling such deep empathy towards the people we are designing for is a very unique experience. As we engaged with the test users, we realized even more how helpful the human centered design was to our solution. The whole process of finding the problem and solving it with the person facing that same problem was a key factor to adding many key features to our solution.
