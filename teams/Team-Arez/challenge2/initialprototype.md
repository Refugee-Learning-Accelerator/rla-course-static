# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

We are testing to find solution to help people who are looking for schools to find information regarding all the schools in Lebanon and can be filtered to include more locations.
We chose this solution because after interviewing a mother of two, we concluded that refugees in general are still out of school since there are many obstacles. To help reduce the number of children that don’t have access to education, we thought of creating a solution that provides information regarding available public and private schools in the region. This information include location, fees, contacts, and can even include scholarships.
### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

We added the application files and some screenshots in the challenge 2 folder.
### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

The technology used is a basic android platform, since most of the market is exposed to android devices, with a centralized database for easy access through the cloud. We tried to keep our application as simple as possible due to the lack of time. 

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

As developers, prototyping with the use of the human centered design was a new and interesting experience, it was as if we were in their shoes. Building empathy towards the people we are designing for was a unique feeling, specially as we saw the solution take shape in the right direction.

### Who are your intended users for testing?

The intended users are refugees in Lebanon. This solution offers them a first step towards finding education.
