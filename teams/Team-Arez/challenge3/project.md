# Challenge 3 Final Project

We want to make an application that would help people firstly communicate using a language they are unfamiliar with, and secondly learn from this process of communication a new language through practice.
Our application would use AR technology to detect an item the user is taking a photo of, and fetch its name and some key communication questions or statements.
This application would translate the item's name, and related questions and statements into the desired language that the user would like to communicate with or learn.

The AR experience is demonstrated in three screenshots uploaded in the challenge3 folder.

## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

Due to the lack of time we were unable to implement our idea into a working prototype. The screenshots demonstrate our AR experience and its functions. We planned on using Xamarin Platform to build the application, making it work on both Android and IOS devices. The fully working application would include some Google APIs to learn about the environment of the items the user is snapping, along with Google Translate API with coordination with APIs from Britannica to provide meaningful questions and statements.

### What challenges did you face?

AR technology is new and it is still an ongoing topic. Problems like the application detecting an item and showing a wrong result is very valid.

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best?

Learning more about AR in the last two weeks, we think the best thing about it is the endless potential ideas that could solve global problems in an easy way. It is also easy to develop with the many platforms and environments.   

### What would you different in the future?

One main feature we would want to add in the future is for the user to listen to the names, questions, or statements the application suggests. Just like in Google Translate, you can listen to the word translated, and learn how to pronounce it. 

### Please also add a link to your code!

As we already mentioned, we were unable to develop the application.
