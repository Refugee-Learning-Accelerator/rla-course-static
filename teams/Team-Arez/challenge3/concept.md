# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch

## Description

Our concept for this week's challenge is to augment the idea presented in this week's seminar. We want to add additional key features, were we use AR to fetch the names of objects in front of the user and try to put them in a useful sentence that the user might be looking to use.
The idea is to not only tell the user what the object in front of him is, but also help him communicate efficiently.

Our concept would display the object's name in the user's chosen language, and translate it to any language. Moreover, the suggested questions or statements that the solution proposes to the user are also translated for him/her to be able to understand them, and use them in any language.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve?

The AR experience will solve the problem of language barriers. The user will be able to identify objects in language they don't speak, and will also be able to use that object in meaningful questions or statements.

### How will the AR experience solve it?

The AR experience will be an efficient tool for the user to communicate in other languages, and slowly learn more through practice.

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

The primary user would be any person who wants to identify objects around him in a language he is unfamiliar with. The AR experience will engage the user by notifications once movement is detected through GPS or built-in sensors, the AR experience would suggest possible objects that the user might be in need of. For example, if the weather is rainy, it will show an umbrella with suggested questions and statements about it with the right translation for the user.

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context?

Any android device with a camera would be enough. It's very realistic in the refugee context since it's a cheap solution to language barriers, and it can be helpful for the user to learn more through practice.

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible?

The AR experience would put together an object identifier, a translator, and a sentence or question composing application all in one.

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

We expect to encounter challenges with the integration of huge APIs and databases into the solution making the it bigger in size and thus harder to download on bad internet. Another challenge would be the quality of identification might differ from one user to another.
