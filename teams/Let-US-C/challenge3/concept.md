# Challenge 3 Concept Sketch


## Description

*[ Augmented Reality can be used to support language learning in different ways. I chose a concept that follows up with the previous prototype that was
a youtube channel to teach elementary children simple subjects. The main aim will be to teach children different geometric shapes through an Android AR 
mobile application. 

The mobile application will function as follows:
When scanning a paper that has a picture of a certain geometric object (a square for example), the application has to display for the user 
the word "Sqaure" on the screen. This basically depends on having certain patterns in the scanned shapes' pictures.

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the AR experience solve? 

*[As discussed in the seminar two weeks ago, adult learners can move forwards and backwards in the online learning tools in order to make sure of 
absorbing the material well. This is not the case with young learners, however this mobile application will help solve this problem.]*

### How will the AR experience solve it? 

*[When using this application, the child himself will control his learning capabilities. That is he/she will switch from scanning  object picture into another 
and consequently learn the objects and shapes' names in a more efficient way.]*

### Who is the primary user and how will the AR experience engage the user?

*[This project will target elementary-level children, mainly grades 1 and 2 or any child that is capable of learning about geometric shapes.
The AR experience will engage the user through Android phones on which the application will be downloaded.]*

### What hardware does the user need? Is this realistic in the refugee context? 

*[The hardware that the user need is an Android phone basically. 
It is somehow realistic in the refugee context where a huge percentage of the refugees have mobile phones, so we will only download the app for them
and provide them with the different objects' and shapes' pictures. The children can be guided at the beginning of the learning process to the way they 
have to use the application. ]*

### What activity does the AR experience facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

*[The children can learn the shapes' names in distinct ways. However, this AR experience will facilitate the possibilty of young refugees to keep track
and follow their own learning progress, that is they will control how much information they absorbed or how well they are good at knowing that this picture 
is a square not a circle...]*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter? 

*[In the implementation process, I think that the challenges that might be encountered will mainly be when assigning the relationship
between the pattern of specific shapes' pictures and displaying their corresponging names.

As for when applying this in the refugees context, I think that there might be a difficulty in dealing with such an application at the beginning of the
learning process, especially that it is a new idea. However, I believe that children will enjoy the AR learning techniques more than other online ones
since they are more fun to deal with and since they will make the refugees closer to the idea of learning since it provides it in a more indirect
and virtual way.]*
