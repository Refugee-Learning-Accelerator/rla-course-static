# Challenge 1 Concept Sketch

## Description

*[Our chatbot mainly focuses on helping refugees start with their learning process or proceed from the phase they've stopped. 
Education Centers are widely spread in our countries these days and they offer various courses for people in different ages. Our goal from
implementing this chatbot will be providing the communication between these centers and the refugees through presenting them information about the available 
centers such as, the centers' location, type of courses offered, required papers and documents, courses' syllabi... 
Also, refugees will have the opportunity to suggest topics for courses they are willing to take but not offered in the center at the moment
and then the center will decide whether to open this new course based on the number of students, availability of teachers, material... ]*

## Questions

### What problem/challenge will the chatbot solve? 

*[The chatbot will help solve the difficulty of communication between refugees and the education centers (By communication, we mean the 
steps refugees pass through to find the suitable center, the suitable classes for them to engage in according to their level,
needed documents to be submitted...).]*

### How will the chatbot solve it? 

*[The chatbot will solve this problem through listing the education centers willing to help refugees in the area and providing details about their 
available programs(special programs for refugees). The level of the person can be specified later through exams done at the center, however, if possible 
we might be able to integrate sample exams for the refugees to take through the chatbot in order to specify their education level.
(The exam would be specified by expertise in the education centers when applying the chatbot in real life)]*

### Who is the primary user and how will the chatbot engage the user?

*[The primary user will be the refugees. The chatbot will engage the users through responding to certain/specific questions (What are the available 
education centers?/What programs are offered in this center?...]*

### What activity does the chatbot facilitate that would not otherwise be possible? 

*[The chatbot facilitates the activity of providing connection between the centers and the refugees through an online interface.
This can be somehow provided through different means, however the chatbot is suitable enough especilly for the use of refugees 
since it will be a simple process of just answering direct questions about courses, programs, centers... ]*

### What challenges do you expect to encounter?

*[I think the challenges we will encounter will mainly be in implementing the chatbot, i.e. programming challenges. As for the applying process, things should 
flow through easily since refugees are willing to learn and most centers should not have a problem in being engaged in the process of supporting
refugees' learning.]*
