# Challenge 2 User Testing

### How did you select your test users? 

*[The test users were mainly based on selecting the people who will interact with this prototype in order to reflect on their feedback.I 
wasn't able to visit refugee children so I selected two children (my cousins) where one is 4 years old and the other is around 5.
 I chose these two children because their ages are suitable for the level of the teaching videos posted on my youtube channel (for grades 1, 2 and 3). ]*

### What was the setting of the test? 

*[The usertesting actually happened in my house where the first child (4 years old) watched the videos about learning the colors and the other child
(5 years old) watched about the body parts.]*
 
### What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 

*[The main points of feedback received are the following:

1- There should be a way to know how much information children are absorbing from these videos that is how much the material is useful for them and
can prepare them for upcoming levels. 
In the testing process, it wasn't the case since I made for them a small test to check what they've understood from the videos. However, we must find a 
suitable solution to track this progress in the case of refugee children.

2- This testing process results can't be exactly projected to the case with the refugee children since the settings and the learning environments
are different between the two, however it is close when looking from the users' perspective, that is same age and level between the users(my cousins)
and refugee children.

### What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?

*[I am aiming to find a solution in order to be able to follow up the progress of the students. I think that this solution will be mainly based on
integrating a seperate prototype (webpage, GUI...) where the students' parents can record their childrens' progress. A training session can be made 
for the parents to make them familiar with the use of this interface.]*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?

*[This is the first time that I built an idea related to the Human Centered Design, however I previously passed through the Ideate and Prototype steps
in previous projects. As for the user-testing phase, I used to usually test my pojects myself however it's not the case with this prototype where 
the testing should be done by appropriate users for the sake of applying it in refugees.
For this, the user-testing/feedback process is the newest to me.]*

### What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?

*[I think that the Ideate process is the most useful to me since the hardest thing in a project is to find the suitable idea that should be applied.
Then, the rest processes are not a big deal as long as the idea is found and suits the purpose of the project.]*
