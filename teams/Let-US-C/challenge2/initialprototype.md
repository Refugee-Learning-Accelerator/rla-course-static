# Challenge 2 Initial Prototype

### What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?)

*[We are testing the solution of providing direct learning techniques for young refugees through a youtube channel.
We chose this method since we intended to make this prototype as tangible as possible by presenting 
the learning process to children in fun and admirable teaching videos.  ]*

### Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)

### Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method. 

*[Our prototype is a youtube channel that presents videos for the sake of teaching young refugees school subjects(Language, Mathematics, and Science). This
channel is categorized into different classes where each category contains videos that suits children of certain levels.
The prototype is at its inital stage containing a small number of videos for three level classes (grade1, grade2, grade3), however more videos
of higher level classes can be added later when bringing this idea to life.
We chose youtube as a prototyoing method since youtube is one of the most common interfaces that people deal with,
and it is a suitable user-friendly interface to present our idea knowing that it is mainly concerned with videos.]*

### What did you learn during the prototyping process?

*[During the prototyping process, we learned that providing educational help for people is not as hard as it actually seems. In fact, the process 
of presenting videos for children gave us the feeling of satisfaction when thinking of the idea that children will access this channel like an e-classrooom
in the future when having more subjects and more levels. ]*

### Who are your intended users for testing?

*[Our intended users for testing are mainly children of specific levels (initially grades 1,2 and 3) where we will make them watch 
our uploaded videos and check if this way of learning would be effective and efficient for young refugees. ]*
