# Make an initial prototype - Due: Sun Nov/19 (midnight Amman)

## Tasks:

* Pick a possible solution to the "How Might We" statement we discussed this week
* Create a prototype (your goal is to make it as tangible/concrete as possible)
* Pick a specific method to design a prototype (e.g., a paper prototype, a series of mockups, or an interactive wireframe). 
* Submit your prototype and documentation (answer the questions below)
* Review the prototypes of 3 other groups and leave feedback. 

## Questions to Answer

1. What solution are you testing? (and why did you choose it?) 

    The problem we indecated is that the refugee students are not getting any quality of learning in the camps and in the city, 
    and they are having a hard time doing there homework and exams as even there parents can't help them, so our solution is to provide them with an online volunteer
    teachers via a mobile app, these teachers will help them with their homework and make them understand what they couldn't understand in the school.

2. Submit your prototype (use photos, video, diagrams etc.)
   We created our prototype as an Android App, we added some interfaces so we can test it with our users and get feedback
   the first interface contains two button to select wether the user is a teacher or a student

   ![Home](home.png) 

   the Arabic version
   
   ![Home](home_ar.png)
   
   - When the user chooses Teacher he/she will go to the Teacher interface where he/she can see a profile pic, his/her name, the status of students available online and how many are needing help and a button to
   start a session which will be a video call with a student. We didn't add the registration process to the prototype to keep it simple and to avoid confusing our users
   when we test it for the first time.
   
   ![Teacher](teacher.png) 

   the Arabic version
   
   ![Teacher](teacher_ar.png)
   
   
   when the teacher touch the start session button a new interface will open for the video call with the student

   the Arabic version
   
   ![connecting](connecting_ar.png)
   
   
   ![session](session.png)


   the Arabic version
   
   ![session](session_ar.png)
   
   
   - When the user chooses Student he/she will go to another interface to choose the grade
     
    

     ![grades](grades.png)

   the Arabic version
   
   ![grades](grades_ar.png)
   
    Then another interface to choose a subject 
    
    
   ![subjects](subjects.png)
    

   the Arabic version
   
   ![subjects](subjects_ar.png)
   
   
   Then the stutent will see how many teachers the App has for the subject he chose and how many are available to help or are currently in a session,
   and will see a button to connect with an available teacher
   
   
   ![student](student.png)
    

   the Arabic version
   
   ![student](student_ar.png)
   
     
   
3. Describe the prototype and why you chose this prototyping method.    

    Our Prototype is an Android app, we did some UI's to explain our solution, and we chose this prototype because it's testable,
    and we can test it with potential users and get feedback from them. 

4. What did you learn during the prototyping process?

    Implementing the human centered design process made us learn a lot about the people we want to help,
    especially when we start thinking like them and we put ourself in there situation, 
    during the prototyping we started to think about the many many features we can add and how much we can improve our solution.


5. Who are your intended users for testing?


    Some refugee studetns inside the camps, and also some refugee students lives in the city attending public school in second shifts at night.
