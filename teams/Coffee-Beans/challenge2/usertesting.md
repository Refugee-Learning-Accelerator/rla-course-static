1. How did you select your test users? 
   When we choose to work on this solution for HCD challenge we were inspired by some family members who are refugee kids attending school in Erbil, Iraq
   so we tested our prototype with them
2. What was the setting of the test? 
   We have an Android App prototype, we used this app with the kids at home and with teachers(potential volunteers) at their workplace.
   for the kids, we did a mockup for the video call and explained to them how the actual call should be.
3. What were the main points of feedback you received (share a summary)? 
   We were impressed by each one of the users and we got a great feedback we would like to share them in details:
   * Rezan, 4 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: he is not a student yet but we wanted to test the UI simplicity with him.
     He was able to use the app and navigate from an interface to another despite that he can't read yet. 
     He suggested that we use Red instead of the current color for the App theme :).
   * Mustafa, 9 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: he liked the App so much and the UI was easy for him to use,
     but he had a problem reading the summary info since he is still learning how to read. 
     He suggested we use voice and text messages besides the video call to communicate with the teachers.
     He was so excited about the idea and kept coming to us asking if we finished developing the App so he can use it :).
   * Leloz, 10 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: she liked the App. the UI was easy for her to use.
     she suggested to use text and voice messages, add icons beside the text on buttons and would like to use Pink instead of the current color for the App theme :).
   * Muslim, 9 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: He liked the App so much "because it helps the student to learn"
     He suggested adding voice and text messages and adding more learning subjects :).
   * Nawal, 27 years old Syrian lives in Erbil: he finds the app good and simple. 
     She suggested adding audio calls and voice messages. "yes I will use the App and volunteer as a teacher!" :).
   * Ahmad, 20 years old Iraqi from Erbil: He likes the idea of helping the refugees through this App.
     He suggested showing a list of available teachers and give the student ability to choose instead of getting a random call each time,
     showing a list of the students who were helped by a teacher so each teacher can track how many he/she helped, 
     adding a time schedule and enable teachers and students to book calls beforehand.
     
4. What changes would make to your idea/project based on the feedback?
   * We will make the App colorful and add icons not just text. 
   * We will add the lists as Ahmad suggested.
5. What parts of the Human Centered Design process were new to you?
   Design Thinking and Prototyping weren't totally new but it was the first time we use them.
6. What parts of the Human Centered Design process seemed most useful to you?
   Ideation: how brainstorming and generating crazy ideas can lead to finding solutions for the problems we face in our daily life and we keep complaining about.
             sometimes during the ideation, we may come up with simple and doable solutions.
   Feedback: capture the user's feedback and modify the solution based on this feedback will generate the most effective solution that makes the users happy!.
