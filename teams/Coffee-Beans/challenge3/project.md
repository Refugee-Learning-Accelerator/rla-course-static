## Questions

### How did you build it? (Platform and technology)

We started building the prototype via Unity, but it's not done yet.

### What challenges did you face?

One challenge was to find an accurate image recognition and the other one was to make the character pronounce the name of the object, 
i think we can overcome these challenges if we have more time.

### What aspect of the AR experience do you like best? 

We think that AR is really entertaining, and using this this aspect in education is very useful.

### What would you different in the future? 

We might work and contribute to one of the image recognition libraries to do it more accurate 

### Please also add a link to your code!
